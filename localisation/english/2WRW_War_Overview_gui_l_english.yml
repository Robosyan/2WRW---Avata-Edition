 wrw_war_mechanics_info_tt:0 "§RThe Second West Russian War§! will undoubtedly go into the annals of history as one of mankind’s bloodiest and most costly wars ever fought; a massive war borne of revanchism fought on a massive front by two superpowers is nothing like we have faced before.\n\nDue to the cost in lives and the long and drawn-out nature of such wars, we will need to placate our people by means of §Yadvancing the front lines§!, §Ycapturing key cities§! or by way of §Ypropaganda§! to make sure our £GFX_war_exhaustion_texticon War Exhaustion doesn’t hinder our war machine.\n\nThere is a catch though; due to both powers having nuclear weapons, we will need to curb our aggressiveness at times or £GFX_tension_texticon §RTension§! will get out of control. Though maintaining a controlled level of £GFX_tension_texticon §RTension§! might prove beneficial for the war effort, too high £GFX_tension_texticon §RTension§! will put the world at risk of being plunged into §enuclear war§!.\n\n§WPeace§! won’t be achieved by racing to the enemy’s capital; you will need to think tactfully and perhaps even make concessions to the enemy to get what you want. Be careful and exploit any possible diplomatic opportunities that might arrive, they might give you more leverage or reduce the enemy’s leverage."

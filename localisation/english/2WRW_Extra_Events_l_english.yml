 star_wars.1.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Star Wars Releases In Theaters"
 star_wars.1.desc: "Theatergoers across the world are celebrating the release of a new cinematic triumph, Star Wars. The tale follows Luke Starkiller, a peasant from the desert planet of Tatooine, as he discovers his destiny as a Jedi Knight and embarks on a journey across the stars.\n\nDescribed by critics as "surprisingly subversive," Star Wars takes place during the Third Galactic War between the Old Republic and the Galactic Reich. Rather than serve the corrupt Republic, Starkiller travels to the contested slave world of Commenor with his Jedi mentor Ben Kenobi to aid the Pan-Galactic Rebellion.\n\nAlthough the Sith Reichführer Darth Vader kills Ben, Luke leads the Rebellion to victory in a space attack on the fearsome Imperial Death Star and forces the Republican and Imperial armies to retreat in tatters."

 star_wars.2.t: "This Time, They've Gone Too Far!"
 star_wars.2.desc: "Dear Prime Minister.\n\nDespite our resolute and noble attempts to assuage the vicious Americans, they have launched yet another propagandistic attack at our nation. An upstart director, a worm named George Lucas, has created an entire work mocking the Japanese people and insulting the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Titled Star Wars, this imperialist film depicts our culture in a completely unacceptable manner. The two belligerents of a so-called Third Galactic War are clearly patterned on the OFN and the Einheitspakt. Does this pig-dog think the Asian people are too stupid to attain spaceflight? But worse than that, the film's antagonist, the genocidal, dishonorable, murderous Darth Vader is a clear dig at our Emperor and the armed forces. He wears black armor patterned off the dō-maru, and fights in the Ittō-ryū style. This “Vader” even forces one of his subordinates to commit seppuku! This film is nothing more than a belligerent, ignorant attempt to insult and demean the Pan-Asian project. At my insistence, several Kenpentai agents are already investigating potential CIA involvement in the project.\n\nPrime Minister, we cannot allow such an insult to go unanswered. For the sake of the Japanese national spirit, we ask you to take immediate action against this filth.\n\nRepresentative Yoshida Minato"

 star_wars.4.t: "Most Impressive"
 star_wars.4.desc: ""I love this part! Everyone shut up!" cried Hauptmann Wagner. Dozens of half-drunk Heer officers turned their attention from flat beers to a flickering movie screen in Munich.\n\n"Charming to the last," Großadmiral Tarkin said from the screen. "You don't know how hard I found it, signing the order to terminate your life." He roughly grasped Senator Leia Amidala's rosy cheek, smudging her makeup.\n\n"I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself," she replied, visibly cringing from the old man's touch.\n\n"Senator Amidala, before your execution," he said, "I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony which will make this Wunderwaffe, this grand battlestation, operational. No star system will dare oppose the Führer now!" The Heer officers cheered as the grey-uniformed Tarkin stalked toward Senator Amidala.\n\n"The more you tighten your grip, Großadmiral, the more systems will slip through your fingers," she retorted.\n\n"Not after we demonstrate the power of this station," Tarkin said with a smirk. "You have determined the system we will destroy first. Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Pan-Galactic Rebellion's base, we will test this weapon's power on your home planet, Alderaan."\n\n"No!" she screamed. "Alderaan is peaceful, we have no weapons, you can't do this!"\n\n"You would prefer another target?" he shouted, "Then name the system!"\n\nSenator Leia peered upon the azure blue of Alderaan's atmosphere in agony. Finally, she answered. "Dantooine," she muttered, defeated. "They're on Dantooine."\n\n"There!" Tarkin cried. "You see Vader, she can be reasonable. Kommodore Sauer, continue with the operation. You may fire when ready."\n\nHauptmann Wagner looked on in glee as the degenerate woman broke down in tears. First, there was the montage of Reich personnel, preparing the great laser that would destroy the subhuman pacifists. Then, the terrible order to ignite. Finally, the weapon fired, exploding the weak planet of Alderaan and suffocating its diluted culture.\n\nAs the Nazis cheered the extermination of Alderaan, Wagner shed a tear. He would never cleanse an entire system of degeneracy like Großadmiral Tarkin. But perhaps his children would."

 star_wars.5.t: "A Safe and Secure Society"
 star_wars.5.desc: "Across the foggy, rain-soaked island of Britain, thousands of fingers snap on their televisions. The screen lights up, they settle into their armchairs and couches, and the news begins.\n\n"The next program now on BBC 2 is: The Georgian," a faceless narrator says. In the background, a luminescent globe spins; all the landmasses of the world are highlighted in fluorescent blue, with a white shine around Britain. "This is BBC 1," the voice reports. Behind the globe, the words "BBC NEWS" flies out of the globe towards the viewer, still cloaked in that otherworldly, fungal blue..\n\nA new voice, still unknown, begins to speak. "Our first topic, protests over the new film "Star Wars". Limited showings of the American-made film have been permitted in London, Birmingham, and Manchester." A static image of hundreds of Britons standing in the street flashes on the screen." Audiences are pouring into seats in record numbers, but some are concerned with what they call ‘immoral content'. Here with the word on the street is Tim Edwards with BBC 1. ".\n\n"Well, I think it's just in bad taste," Nancy Davies said into the offered microphone. "This so-called "Pan-Galactic Rebellion" clearly takes inspiration from the HMMLR terrorist organization. Is this really what we want our children viewing? Garbage that promotes violent revolution and guerilla warfare? I think Britain has had quite enough of that," she said..\n\n"And your group is protesting outside Regent Street Cinema for what reason, Madam?" Edwards says..\n\n"Well, first of all, I think these people ought to feel ashamed of themselves," she says. "The Americans are mugging off our entire country, convincing us to line up for hours in the rain to watch some trite garbage filmed in a desert. But more than that I want parents and youngsters to think about the message this movie is sending. I lost friends in the Civil War. Good people too. And we have to be properly careful to keep pro-terrorist messaging away from the people we love.".\n\nThe screen shifts from the interview, and into the BBC 1 studio. A middle-aged man in a brown and silver striped tie speaks directly into the camera. "That was Nancy Davies, head of the Concerned Mothers Resource Center. As similar protests have grown across the country, several members of Parliament have moved to allow no further viewings of "Star Wars" in the Kingdom. Before we move on to the next item, we'd like to discuss signs that your children or loved ones may have been exposed or indoctrinated into radical viewpoints.".\n\n"

 star_wars.6.t: "We're On a Diplomatic Mission!"
 star_wars.6.desc: "George Lucas sat at the back of a crowded London theater, hands full of an empty bag of popcorn. British concessions were so small- hell, he'd finished the greasy crap before the Millenium Falcon had even left Mos Eisley. But his trembling legs wouldn't carry him to a trash can. Tonight was the first- the very first- showing of "Star Wars" in England. Sure, his baby had been a success in America. God, that wasn't even close to a strong enough word. It had been an artistic triumph he didn't expect and didn't deserve. But, to think that his work, the movie he'd spent years working on, could be an international hit? That was too much.\n\nOn the enormous movie screen, a fanfare thundered. Han Solo, Luke Starkiller, and the alien Chewbacca strode down a red carpet, surrounded by cheering rebels, to receive the Medal of Yavin. George smiled to himself. It really had been a nightmare, knitting together the music, surgically placing the cameras, hunting down the right cast. Not to mention the shit with the passports! They'd nearly lost Guinness right then and there. Thank God 20th Century had a backdoor or the entire production would've flatlined.\n\nBut now was the worst part. The credits began to roll, and the audience stood from their seats. Would they hate it? George knew the English were more reserved than Americans. They'd probably leave without a word, walk home to their families and tell them all about the miserable garbage he'd shown them. It was too childish. It was too fantastical. It was too strange, too different, too silly, too.... Everything. Could he make it to the exit without anyone noticing him?\n\n"Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen," an attendant yelled from the back. George froze. "Thank you for joining us this evening for our showing of Star Wars! We have a special guest- the director, Mister Lucas. Mr.Lucas, would you please stand so our guests may see you?"\n\nGeorge wobbled too his feet. He began to sweat as he offered a weak smile to the waiting crowd. But one by one, they took their feet, and began to applaud with the ferocity of a hurricane."

 star_wars.7.t: "Peace is a Lie"
 star_wars.7.desc: ""The chair recognizes Senator Ted Stevens, of Alaska." In the background, a dozen reporters turned their cameras and microphones to the visibly angry legislator.\n\nStevens leaned into his microphone and smiled a false smile. "Thank you, Chairman Adams. And thank you to all the representatives and citizens who have taken the time to attend this hearing," he said. He shuffled his notes, then began to speak.\n\n"National Security and culture are not often items we expect to intersect," he said. "Nevertheless, we are blessed to live in a free society, which values freedom of speech and the right to discuss issues of political importance. It is no surprise that artists have chosen to directly address the issues of the day throughout this Cold War." Stevens wiped his reading glasses on his shirt sleeve, then continued.\n\n"Patriotic Americans, Americans who understand that we are blessed to live in a country guarded by the Constitution and the Founding Father's wishes, have graced us with movies, T.V. shows, and books celebrating our great nation. Others have sought to portray the Jap scourge as it ravages our friends in China and Southeast Asia. Why, just the other day, I had the chance to head down to Toys-R-Us and buy my son Walter a couple of Adventure Team action figures. But," he said, raising a trembling finger, "some of our neighbors don't understand America's role in preventing the spread of fascism."\n\n"This popular new movie, Star Wars, is a perfect example of entitled, elitist moderates spitting in the face of our efforts to spread democracy and freedom across the world. We're all aware that the film features a conflict between a corrupt, thuggish Old Republic and the Galactic Reich. And we all know the Republic is meant to be the United States, and the Reich is meant to symbolize the Nazis. Now I have no problem with criticizing America. We have a lot of growing up to do, as RFK said. But I do," he raised his voice, stabbing his finger into the wooden podium, "take issue with this both-sides centrist garbage. Nazism, as a political movement, is an evil we have never faced before in the history of humanity. The stories I've heard from veterans of the England and African fronts, the information the CIA has briefed on me, well it's enough to turn the strongest man's stomach. You do not know the sorts of atrocities these fascist bastards have committed."\n\nHe stood up, looming over the microphone like a lion about to pounce. "And so, Mr. Lucas, I have this to say. You are a coward. America isn't perfect. But we can't spare a damn second until we've defeated fascism everywhere until the peoples of the world are safe from genocide and enslavement. Your pathetic attempt to equate our imperfect, democratic, constitutional order with National Socialist dictatorship sickens me, and it ought to sicken every American in the whole damn country.""

 star_wars.8.t: "A New Hope"
 star_wars.8.desc: "A few weeks ago, the film simply titled "Star Wars" came to theatres across Russia. The film initially performed relatively poorly due in large part to the lack of interest and access across the country to theatres. While Old Soviet Russia had quite a few film-related artists, Russian society has lacked any serious effort to reboot the film industry due to the numerous other aspects of the economy needing the resources and investment. What theatre's Russia does have are few and have only been built in the last few years in major cities.\n\nBut a dramatic change has occurred, with many initial viewers encouraging others to see it, causing a turnaround in the box office. Today in cities like Moscow, Samara, Irkutsk, extremely long lines go out of every theatre. Despite initially being believed to be a failure in Russia, the film has become the highest-grossing film in the Russian market and reached a cult-like status. Most of the praise for the film comes from the rapidly growing youth population, who have fallen in love with this modern Classic.\n\nMany wonder why the film has touched the nation so deeply. Many point to the film's themes of fighting against evil, a struggle the Russian people are all too familiar with, others point to the revolutionary technical effects; some simply argue that this was merely the right film at the right place. Regardless of the reasons why "Star Wars" has captured the hearts of millions and ignited a fire in the nation. Many have started to call for the development of modern cultural arts and for Russia to build a film industry to rival Italy, America, or Japan. Some rumors have even suggested that there are those interested in convincing George Lucas to film portions of the next film in Russia to show how far the nation has come."

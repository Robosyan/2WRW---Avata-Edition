 TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_NOV_RSLP: "In spite of a constant uphill battle, from the bustling cities of San Francisco to the stalwart metropolis of Moscow the world is united in peaceful cooperation toward a brighter future. The dreams of one lone man from the tundra of Siberia has triumphed over the plagues of authoritarianism and war.\n\nRussia's people walk on newly-paved roads and reap the rewards of prosperity. They enjoy leisure under a clear blue sky and are ready to see what the future has in store. In these ways, Anatoly Koryagin leaves Russia a transformed nation for the better. Not all challenges have been overcome at home or abroad, but in spite of overwhelming odds, the torch of liberty, now intertwined between East and West, burns bright, and Russia and her allies stand ready to defend its flame with valor and dignity in the pursuit of peace."
 TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_NOV_DSPR: "From Moscow to Saratov, Yekaterinburg to Novosibirsk, Russia has embarked upon an arduous and unrelenting march of progress. The wealthy retreat from the unstoppable tide of Socialism and the once omnipresent megacorporations have been left in ashes. In these ways, Leonid Kantorovich and his grand ambitions for the Federation have succeeded.\n\nHowever, the forces of reaction and the reluctance of Russia's people to accept this future remain an ever-present obstacle. Many of the President's promises remain unfulfilled, a failure which may prove fatal to his administration, and such rapid and uncompromising change has created more enemies than allies within Russia as many, even the common man himself, outright reject the path Kantorovich has laid out. The vision of an equal and free Federation is not yet lost, but with the support of his people all but gone it may prove a problem too difficult to overcome, one that not even the best equation can solve."
 TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_NOV_RAPP: "All of Russia and her people are quiet in jubilation. They have seen their share of pain from the sorrow of the Smuta and the Siloviki. But now, with Vasily Shukshin, democracy has finally been brought to the Federation. Steady reform and victory against the Reich have brought the people a new age of prosperity and freedom. From the banks of the Ob onward, a feeling unfamiliar to Russia has begun to take root: hope.\n\nAlthough the future may be bright, there are still challenges to the President. With the dissolution of the German sphere, Russia has now taken on the spotlight and burden of the hegemon of Eurasia, and the scars of war upon the continent remain, possibly never to heal. But as long as the dream of freedom is maintained, no matter how closely darkness encroaches Russia shall be safe and the Federation will triumph."
 TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_NOV_VRPP: "The halls of the Duma have gone silent, and Russia has been sold out to the highest bidder. The effects of President Primakov's greed can be seen in the sorrow of every working citizen and the laughs of every corporate magnate. This Federation’s ideals have been tarnished and thrown to the wind for the sake of the pockets of the VRPP's corporate benefactors, and the pessimism and political apathy of Pokryshkin's Federation has returned under the guise of 'pragmatism.'\n\nFaced with an ever-growing divide between poor and rich, a quickly deteriorating environment, and the slow corrosion of civil liberties, pain and suffering will not discriminate between the worthy and unworthy of Russia. As the dream of democracy fades and the specters of the Federation's past return to haunt it, the nation struggles to maintain hope. But, the Federation has been in this place before. Perhaps it can claw its way out of the clutches of tyranny yet again, before all has been lost."
 TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_NOV_Zubakov_Coup: "What makes a man Russian? Is it his morals? His values? His patriotism? In the eyes of the megacorporations and their mouthpiece Zubakov, it is how deep their pocket goes.\n\nAs the country riots over the death of their newfound martyr, Vasily Shukshin, his ideals and dreams for Russia begin to fade. As compatriots no longer recognize compatriots, fighting over the scraps of their beloved motherland, only anger, frustration, and violence remain. For better or worse, Yuri Zubakov has started a new age of Russian degradation and vice.\n\nThe optimism of Shukshin's presidency has been left a distant memory, likely never to return. For any fire the Russian people may put out, dozens more take their place. Zubakov has doomed Russia to a future of plutocracy and senseless greed, and the light of hope may have been stamped out for the final time."
 TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_NOV_Shukshin_Counter_Coup: "When President Shukshin had first set out on his quest for the Russian people to breathe free in a true democracy, he had an unmatched fervor. He fought the Silvoki's greed, mended the scars inflicted by the Smuta, and brought victory against the Reich. He worked to undo the decades of damage caused by Nazi rule over Eastern Europe. But as the President presides over a nation yet again broken by lust for power and control, he sees that his work has been in vain.\n\nHis decades of effort have been undone in the wake of Primakov's presidency, and what's more, the corporate puppet Zubakov has left the Federation a broken state, its government corrupted far beyond anything Pokryshkin could have imagined. Now, all Shukshin can do is ensure that such a crime is never allowed to happen again. As long as he can protect Russia, as long as he is the only one who can protect Russia, he can prevent another like Zubakov. Even if it takes sacrificing the democracy he once dreamed of."
 TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_NOV_Failure: "When Russia set out on their crusade against the Nazis, the hearts of the Russian people were full of desire to finally see Eastern Europe cast off the Jackboot that had occupied it for decades. The Russian Federation’s newly modernized army and industrial base finally seemed a powerful enough force to rival the German Reich. But now the final bell has tolled for Russia and the chance of freedom in Eastern Europe.\n\nWhatever remnants of the Russian administration exist are now fighting back against the darkness, yearning to reunify Russia again. But the vultures of Japan and Germany have picked off what little is left of the Federation's corpse ripe for the taking, and the peoples of Siberia have declared an end to Russia's rule over their people. Whatever light is left within Russia, its dim presence is not enough to save the once proud nation. Russia has been lost, possibly forever."
 
 TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_RUS_Communist_Victory: "When the Nazis destroyed the Soviet Union three decades ago, many believed that it was the end of Bolshevism in the lands of Russia. Yet the ideology which had first unchained the Russian people remained in some corners of Russia, and by the beginning of the decade it had spread to encompass the whole nation. With the Russian proletariat united in their struggle, they turned their gaze westward to their comrades still toiling under the Nazi yoke.\n\nAnd in the conflagration that followed, they emerged triumphant to smash the German eagle and avenge the fallen of the Red Army. What comes next is a mystery to the proletariat of Eurasia, but one thing is for certain: the end of the twentieth century promises to be the herald of a new age. A Red Age."
 TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_RUS_Communist_Defeat: "The Red Army marched westward once more, and again it was smashed by the might of the German Reich. Hope had briefly returned to the workers and peasants of Russia as the red light of Communism spread its promises of a future without chains across the nation. Having turned its gaze westward to try and avenge the historical injustice the Nazis have inflicted on her people, Russia has failed as its forebears did so many times before.\n\nWhat follows this final failure is unknown as the remnants of the Union reel from their loss. But, with the Reichsadler's wings soaring over Europe, there is one truth in the ruins of the Union's gambit: there will never again be a Bolshevik threat to Germany's world order. Communism has failed the people of Eurasia, and its proletariat are consigned to an eternity of darkness."
 TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_RUS_Democratic_Victory: "For the first time since the tumultuous days of 1917, democracy has been brought to the lands of Russia. Starting as a small statelet hoping for a better tomorrow, Russia is now governed by the forces of liberty and the rule of law. And, with the country united behind the dream of freedom, Russia marched westward and smashed the German Reich, bringing the light of democracy to Eurasia.\n\nWhat comes after is a mystery to both the Russian people and the rest of Eurasia. But there is one thing for certain: a new light shining across Europe, a light declaring democracy and freedom for all."
 TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_RUS_Democratic_Defeat: "The light of freedom has faltered, perhaps forever extinguished from the lands of Russia. Having started as a small statelet as an oasis of freedom in a sea of despair, by the beginning of the decade liberty and democracy had been brought to all Russia. And in the hearts and minds of the Russian people, true freedom could not be achieved until the Nazi menace had been shattered. Yet it was all for naught.\n\nThe Heer's boot has stomped out the light of democracy as freedom and prosperity remains forever out of reach for the people of Eurasia. With the German Eagle stronger than ever, there is one truth that is apparent to all: there will never again be a strong and united Russia. She shall forever be a footnote in history's dark shadow…"
 TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_RUS_Authoritarian_Victory: "In the chaos of the Russian Anarchy, a new order arose from the ashes of the old. Communism would no longer weaken the Russian people's resolve to fight for their nation's security. No longer would democracy disrupt the order and stability necessary for a strong Russian state. Instead, the Russian people were molded by the promises of lead and steel.\n\nUnder these promises, the Russian bear savaged the decadent and gilded German eagle in a display not seen in decades, and came out victorious. As a new order has been brought to the lands of Eurasia, one thing for certain: the Russian people are forever tied to the leader that brought order from chaos, hope from despair, and unity from division."
 TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_RUS_Authoritarian_Defeat: "Through the chaos of the Russian Anarchy, the people of Russia were unified by the power of steel and lead. United behind a strong leader, they were promised the world; the Nazis would be cast aside, and the Russian state would emerge triumphant and strong, just as was her destiny. Yet the people's worst fears have been realized. The Reich tore out the heart of the Russian bear, and once more shattered the resolve of her people.\n\nFor the people of Eurasia, the grip of Nazi tyranny continues unabated. As the Heer parades through the streets from Rotterdam to Moscow, one fact has been cemented into the annals of history: Russia shall remain forever weak and disunited, consigned to the dustbin of history."
 TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_RUS_Fascist_Victory: "When the Soviet Union was shattered three decades ago, many believed that the people of Russia would never rise again. History has proven them wrong. Restored to greatness by the fascist example, the Russian people have followed the lessons of their Germanic foe and allowed the love of blood and soil to enter their hearts. And, united once more behind this immortal creed, they have smashed the German Reich and taken the mantle of the Eurasian juggernaut.\n\nThe future for Russia and her hegemony is largely uncertain, yet it is clear that, as one fascist empire falls, another has risen to take its place. Perhaps it is a sign that no matter what course history takes, the specter of Adolf Hitler’s legacy is doomed to rule the Old World."
 TNO_CountryClosing_epilogue_RUS_Fascist_Defeat: "When the Russian people set out on this crusade to take their rightful place as the hegemon of Eurasia, their faith was absolute and their resolve foolproof. But it seems even with the faith of the Russian people, their leader has failed them. They were promised that, as the strongest race on earth, they would succeed where other men–weak men–had failed. Yet now they are shattered, the Reichsadler delighting in their pain.\n\nWhat comes next is a mystery to the men and women of the old world. But with the Russian eagle broken and scattered across Siberia’s cold, merciless wastes, there is only one path left for Russia: a continued cycle of pain, misplaced hope, and envy for the empire of old."

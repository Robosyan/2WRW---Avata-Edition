 NPP_collapse.1.t:0 "Hard Hat Riots"
 NPP_collapse.1.desc:0 "The streets of Boston today were filled from sidewalk to sidewalk with angry student protestors who voiced their outrage and concerns over the involvement of American ground forces wrapped up in the Middle East. As the Oil Crisis escalates into further intervention in other nations, young Americans, specifically those of draft age, took over Boston's city center and held an 8-hour demonstration, as riot police tried to disperse the crowds back to their homes to no avail.\n\nDuring the final few hours of the protest, harbor workers who had just finished up their shifts made a detour towards the city center, dawning their hard helmets as they attempted to break up the protests violently. Students knocked out cold lay in the streets as the harbor workers fought their way to the city center, beginning to break up the large-scale demonstrations.\n\nEventually, shield-bearing officers and state troopers had to be brought in to deal with the two riots unfolding simultaneously. Hundreds were hospitalized as water cannons, riot clubs, and tear gas countered the protestors with methodical tactics. However, as police came upon the Hard Hat rioters, few put up much of a fight against them, instead opting to help the police against the student protestors.\n\nBy the time the Hard Hat rioters had driven off the students, they began their own rally in favor of American involvement overseas, praising the brave men and women who had and were actively giving their lives to fight the good fight. More and more people — mainly non-students — swelled up the rally as cheers and applause filled the streets with Boston rather than jeers of outrage against the government.\n\nThe scenes of the violence shocked Americans from coast to coast, drawing more counter-protests to the many student riots that are currently sweeping the nation. After all was said and done, just over 1,000 students and workers found themselves locked up overnight in jails, with just two deaths reported amidst the chaos that unfolded today."

 NPP_collapse.2.t:0 "Weatherman Underground"
 NPP_collapse.2.desc:0 "A new wave of civil disobedience has gripped the American public today, with reports of bombings taking place across the country. The intended targets of these bombings were government facilities from coast to coast. Ranging from an ROTC barracks on the University of Wisconsin's grounds to a bomb that failed to detonate found inside the New York Stock Exchange, tens of thousands of police officers across the country have been called on to deal with this newfound threat.\n\nThe perpetrators behind these bombings have been traced back to a radical student-led organization known as "The Weathermen Underground," after taking their namesake from a Bob Dylan lyric. A spokesperson for the Weathermen has declared an all-out attack against the "reactionary" government under the auspice of President Goldwater.\n\nSo far, at least seven lives have been claimed in these bombings, with a further 34 injured as well. The president has declared an emergency holiday for all government buildings and banks in order to prevent more casualties and to help expedite police in determining if any more bombs were planted inside said buildings, but has yet to make a comment on the situation at hand.\n\nMoreover, the Weathermen vow to continue the bombings until the government changes its policies across the board. An organized demonstration of the Weathermen is set to occur at the National Mall in Washington, D.C. The protestors will be heavily under watch by both police forces and national guardsmen to ensure a peaceful assembly takes place."

 NPP_collapse.3.t:0 "A Fracturing Populace"
 NPP_collapse.3.desc:0 "The cacophony of yells from the defiant crowd and the firing of tear gas shrouded John's senses as he blacked out. When he returned to the light, he found himself being physically dragged into the violent commotion by the Missouri National Guard. John, a 20-year-old, outspoken member of the youth organization of the NPP Progressives, was among thousands of others in the turbulent streets of Kansas City, engaging in a mass riot engulfing perhaps most of the city's downtown, a second Bleeding Kansas. As the young man was jostled around and restrained by the National Guard, the racket of the mob grew louder, a piercing noise that would rumble throughout downtown and further intensify the pervasive chaos.\n\n"Let me off! Goddamnit, don't tackle me!" John hurled, trying to elude the three, much more experienced National Guardsmen. Louder screeches come from John, trying to catch the attention of the crowd in close quarters with the National Guards unit. The violent brawl grew more tumultuous as the physical engagement diverted the Guardsmen's attention, allowing John to wrestle himself out of the grasp of the National Guardsmen. John went for it, sprinting down the street as feasibly as he could in spite of his fractured collarbone. His injuries and the roars of the crowd shadowed over the fine details of the commotion, but one sound could be made out.\n\nBang.\n\nA synchronous fire of rubber bullets sprayed the crowd, with John being no exception. The round lodged in his chest as he swiftly fell to the ground, completely incapacitated, unable to discern what just happened. The rioting mob fled the scene, with the commotion ensuing to pandemonium as all John could do was watch– stationary from the asphalt. The silhouettes of other protesters lying stationary on the ground were visible, as the only thing that was audible besides the blood rushing into John's head was the screeching sounds of the ambulance sirens. John wheezed violently as a thousand thoughts raced through his head. He figured this was it, one final realization followed by a painful wheeze."

 NPP_collapse.4.t:0 "A Fracturing Caucus"
 NPP_collapse.4.desc:0 "Another year, another convention, the years have been turbulent for the NPP, especially in the Nationalists with the uprise in demands for civil rights, yet hopefully the worst has passed, right?... Right? The Convention started off smoothly with small speeches from both Progressives and Nationalists. But eventually, it couldn't stay that way.\n\nEventually, it seemed that what started as a small disagreement continued into screaming and shouting. It would've seemed that everyone forgot what the main disagreement was. But it looked like it didn't matter. Hollis tried to move out of the increasingly vitriolic crowd, with the respective speech-holders attempting to carry on despite the convention failing to address the growing storm of jeers and fist clenching. Yet eventually the ones who held their composure couldn't even hear the speech-holders from the amount of noise. Hollis finally got into a quiet corner and looked over his shoulder only to see the delegates now yell and start to shove each other. Hollis eventually got to sit down next to a fellow older nationalist, he was holding his cane in front of him while shaking his head.\n\n"Tribalism, young man, tribalism our politics has become."\n\nHollis opened his mouth to say a response but before he could, he saw a nationalist from Alabama roll up his sleeve and punch a progressive from Oregon in the nose, he fell backward and was caught by his fellow colleagues with security pushing through the crowd. Hollis looked at the elder sitting next to him and saw that he was simply shaking his head before letting out a sigh."

 NPP_collapse.5.t:0 "A Red in the White House?"
 NPP_collapse.5.desc:0 "It was quieter than usual on Pennsylvania Avenue as very few cars could be heard, ambling to and fro. Within a dimly-lit conference room, several well-respected and well-known Nationalist delegates congregated, tossing around a lighter, planning their next move. The remnants from a convention earlier that day streaked across the desk in front of them: lost cups of coffee, scattered sheets, and reports.\n\nEven now, they could not believe it; the Nationalists' nightmare, a Red, nominated as their leader? Sure, times were hard, but was that Bolshevik their last option? Their savior? Angry mumbling and conversations ensued, all debating on what to do now. They could not remove him as the Pact's nominee — that much was clear — but maybe they could try to discourage him from pursuing their dreams of 'World Revolution.' Soon, each plan grew more radical and impossible than the other. Once they realized this, they remorsefully concluded that there was nothing that they could do.\n\nThe party that they built had betrayed them.\n\nOne last option remained. If the Nationalists could not suffocate the Red from within their party, they would take him down in another. A mass exodus of Nationalists to the Republicans was the only way, and it seemed that every member hesitantly agreed. However, unbeknownst to them, a group of progressives in the room just across from them were discussing the same concerns. They did not like the idea of a communist president, as it was practically the last straw of the already fragile coalition, but the coalition's survival was not the main issue for them — it was what Hall was planning to do. They knew that the NPP-M was not run by cowards and would push their objectives through hell or high water. They all shook their heads; they just had to hope for a miracle that might save the coalition."
 NPP_collapse.5.a:0 "One that will have to come soon."
 
 NPP_collapse.6.t:0 "Avoiding Weimar"
 NPP_collapse.6.desc:0 "The atmosphere was tense. Many delegates were visibly sweating. The speaker himself was not at ease either; he was just about to announce what might be the end of the coalition. Hands were tapping on the laps of the delegates, with very few trying to break the tension with a small chat or joke, but it seemed to no avail. The speaker's heart was pumping, nothing but silence. It was uncanny, as until now, every NPP convention had noise issues. The Progressives, Nationalists, and Vanguards were simply sitting and waiting for the announcement. The Vanguards, however, seemed more relaxed than anyone else in the convention. In the middle of them all sat Yockey himself, calmly exchanging words with everyone around him with a slight grin on his face. The speaker walked up to the podium, and as the flash of lights nearly blinded him, he took a deep breath and began to speak.\n\n"Ladies and Gentlemen of the National Progressive Pact, we are about to announce our candidate for the upcoming election, but first a few words..."\n\nYockey raised his eyebrow, and his grin grew. It was clear the speaker was trying to prepare everyone for the news.\n\n"Firstly, I would like to stress the fact that we have all kept the great coalition united for many years and many years to come as we still have great things to accomplish, so without further ado, let's announce our candidate." He stuttered at every other word he spoke, and he hadn't even said the worst part yet. "Francis Parker Yockey from the National Vanguard Party."\n\nThe entire convention hall went into uproar, with the progressives standing up and openly jeering. The speaker wiped his sweat away from his forehead. Eventually, in a move nobody expected, the entire NPP Progressive wing picked up their things and, in a show of solidarity, walked together in an orderly manner out of the convention Hall. Yockey's grin turned quickly into a smile, and he muttered something in a delegate's ear."

 NPP_collapse.7.t:0 "Dealing with the Democrats"
 NPP_collapse.7.desc:0 "The cabinet room was quiet compared to usual, the familiar aroma of cigarette smoke only faintly present, though that was to be expected given the lack of occupancy, having only two people in it. Hubert Humphrey stood up from his chair, shaking the hand of the man who had just entered the room, he had been just on time. Henry ‘Scoop’ Jackson let out a smile at the hand shake, it was a good sign, at the least.\n\n"Good Evening Scoop, to what do I owe the pleasure?" Humphrey sat down, then leaned forward in his chair, which Scoop replied by doing the same as he rubbed his tired eyes.\n\n"As discussed over the phone, which I'm sure you have taken note of, I have held a party meeting in which we debated the future of the coalition, it is now apparent that there is a need for change following the steadily dwindling support for the NPP."\n\nHumphrey nodded, taking in the news. He expected this kind of visit at some point, though he didn't expect it so soon. "And what conclusion did your conference reach?"\n\n"After a long debate that went in circles, we concluded that seeking to re-integrate with the Democrat party would be the best course of action for a multitude of reasons. I assume that this action was expected by us, yes?"\n\nHumphrey couldn't help but meet the question with a nostalgic smile of his own as he leaned back in his chair. He had always imagined a future where the progressives would return to the fold, yet he had refrained from thinking of it too much, doubtful of such a return. Yet, the man sitting before him, head of the NPP-P was offering a chance to make things right."
 NPP_collapse.7.a:0 "Hubert smiled as the left’s prodigal sons finally returned."
 
 NPP_collapse.8.t:0 "A Deal with the Donkey"
 NPP_collapse.8.desc:0 "Papers were strewn all across the cabinet room floor as the ongoing negotiations dragged itself out, all of it requiring many different clauses and signatures for different legislation to review and account for. Now, the formal end of the Progressive wing was a few signatures ahead.\n\n"-and these were already brought up, such issues had been addressed here, and over here." Scoop pointed to one of the several different files present, Humphrey only scratched his head, the last few months had been ironing out potential issues from the Progressives before the whole party merged into the Democrats, different laws in different counties, all previously handled by the NPP.\n\nLooking over the papers once more, Humphrey gave a chuckle. "To be frank, I never thought that the discussions here would go so well. Though now it's apparent to me, I'm willing to agree to your terms, the sheer multitude of them, at least." he chuckled.\n\nScoop reciprocated Humphrey's chuckle with a modest, albeit tired, smile."We'll hold a press conference next week on Monday then, to announce the end of… well, an era I dare say. The end of the National-Progressive Pact." The words hardly felt real leaving Scoops mouth, the party he worked so hard for was coming to an end. The vision of America that men like him and Patton had tried to make reality for so long was now a pile of ashes. Although, when Scoop thought more about it, an America that served both people like Scoop and people like Patton just simply could not be made manifest. A political party founded by members of extremely opposite views, it was a wonder this homunculus of a party took so long to finally expire."
 NPP_collapse.8.a:0 "Yet all it took to die was a signature on a piece of paper."
 
 NPP_collapse.9.t:0 "A Dead Party Walking"
 NPP_collapse.9.desc:0 "Snap.\n\nChristopher sighed, looking at the tip of the broken graphite that was previously present in his pencil; this was the third time it had broken in the last hour, and typically, this would be cause for frustration, given his habit of purchasing cheap pencils. It hardly mattered to him in the end since his work was already done, the broken graphite forming a full stop to his conclusion.\n\nIn front of Christopher was an unorganized heap of graphs and statistics, procured all by himself. This wasn't just about anything simple; instead, it was detailing the rapid drop in party strength of the NPP. Whether it was denial or blind ignorance, this hardly made sense to those still loyal to the party, and initially, it had hardly made sense to even him, which had brought him to figure it all out by himself. The Progressive defection and internal split within the Nationalists over abortion rights surely could not have caused this much of a calamity, could it?\n\nDespite all of this, all the evidence was apparent to him, from the drastically falling support for the NPP-N to the declining numbers in party members; the party that for so long aligned to his views was not long for America and her people, and soon the failures of the Nationalists would be apparent to the whole world.\n\nRubbing his head, Christopher organized and filed away the mess that was present on his desk. The supporters that were leaving the Nationalist wing were flocking en-masse to the Republican party, though this hardly came as a surprise to him; if anything, it was only natural, given where the founders of the NPP-N and even the progressives used to align."

 NPP_collapse.10.t:0 "Rocking the Boat"
 NPP_collapse.10.desc:0 "Over the course of the last several months, leading figures in the Democratic Party have noticed that their Republican counterparts have time and time again proven just how polarized they are when working together alongside the Democrats. Leading Democratic members of the House and the Senate have called upon Republican leaders to either get their party in line with the coalition or face its total dissolution. With increasing pressure applied to the legislators, talks have begun over the necessary next steps for the future of the coalition — and the country.\n\nOne idea that had floated around was a large meeting of leaders from both sides to discuss and encourage political discourse rather than opting to continue down the path of a congress that remains divided in all but name. While many analysts doubt that these talks will create any meaningful progress, the step is seen to leading Democrats as a vital move in the right direction to preserve the conformity of the Republican-Democratic Coalition.\n\nFurthermore, Republican leaders themselves are publicly doubting whether or not these talks will even be necessary for the coalition to progress forward, as their only demand is for the Democrats to simply hear them out and compromise on the demands set forth by the Republicans.\n\nMany analysts and critics in and outside of Washington see this as the beginning of the end for the coalition, with even more attempts to strategize and figure out the next steps for each party following its inevitable dissolution. Democrats have launched a counter to these claims, stating that the coalition is not finished until all possible avenues of approach are exhausted. Few believe the Democrats' willingness to make a deal with their Republican counterparts, but for the time being, the fate of the coalition rests on these talks alone."

 NPP_collapse.11.t:0 "The Unsinkable Ship..."
 NPP_collapse.11.desc:0 "The air filled with anger in the Democratic National Committee as George Romney was comfortably re-elected as the candidate for the Republican-Democratic Coalition. While not unexpected from the incumbent Romney, renominating a social conservative and devout Mormon has proved too much for the Democrats.\n\nAfter a meeting including top Democrats, the Democratic Party has decided to end the years-long coalition. This decision comes in the wake of the landmark ruling of Roe vs Wade, the Supreme Court case that gave women the right to an abortion, creating a firm split between the pro-choice Democrats and the pro-life Republicans. Romney himself was firmly pro-life, which only added fuel to the flame. Additionally, the dissolution of the NPP only helped further the divide between the Republicans and Democrats, as the party ranks on both sides were filled with more extreme members.\n\nNow, America enters a new yet tested party system, of Republicans versus Democrats, of the elephant against the donkey. The Democrats now must quickly find a nominee to unite their party in the aftermath of the split if they want any chance to evict Romney from the White House."

 NPP_collapse.12.t:0 "Blowing Up the Boat"
 NPP_collapse.12.desc:0 "Ronald Reagan has done what nobody thought would be possible. The star of the silver screen has somehow clinched the Republican-Democratic nomination against incumbent Jeane Kirkpatrick. Reagan’s path here is nothing less than stellar for the congressman who originated as an actor for Hollywood Westerns. Despite supporting the Republican Party, Reagan eventually joined the NPP and was asked to run for governor of California in 1966. Reagan accepted the nomination and won with a landslide due to his popularity and Hollywood charm. He declined to run for a third term in ‘74 and instead has been sowing the seeds for a presidential run since the merge of the NPP and the Republicans. Now, he is reaping the rewards as he has been nominated for the presidency. Reagan’s platform of 'anti-big government' seems to have been received well by many Americans after four years of Kirkpatrick’s hands-on approach to domestic affairs.\n\nThe nomination of the arch-conservative Reagan and the dethroning of Kirkpatrick has sent the Democrats into a tailspin. Almost immediately, prominent Democrats and other liberal-leaning congressmen started calling for the dissolution of the Republican-Democrat coalition. A vote was called in the DNC regarding the split, and the Democrats unanimously voted in favor of splitting from their long-time counterparts. As of today, the Democrats broke off from the coalition, ending the decades-long alliance. Jeane Kirkpatrick was soon nominated as the Democratic nominee for President, and now, as America enters a new party system, the incumbent president and former Hollywood actor will face off come November."

 NPP_collapse.13.deadlock.t:0 "The Iceberg"
 NPP_collapse.13.deadlock.desc:0 "It was an absolute deadlock, and both sides and everyone affiliated with them knew it. Both Democrats and Republicans had selected a candidate that they were entirely certain would win over a majority in the name of progress, strength, patriotism, and so many other buzzwords that delegates love to sling around.\n\nHowever, the two sides found themselves in a deadlock, with neither side willing to concede their chosen candidate. Attempts to field a compromise candidate were made in a last-ditch attempt to salvage the floundering coalition, but holdouts from the relatively few but vocal activist wings of the parties pressed for their sides to hold their ground until the other side eventually saw sense. This hope proved futile, as both compromise candidates failed to gain a majority due to the blocs of Democratic and Republican delegates voting for Kennedy and Reagan, respectively.\n\nThe silence and inaction of the incumbent NPP president only compounded the problem further, as neither side could use a presidential recommendation as an edge in the endless debates that had taken place up until the present. It was apparent to all involved that there would be only one option; with consent from both parties, the coalition was dissolved. For the first time in two decades, the Democrats and Republicans would field their respective candidates as opposing parties.\n\nIt was not wholly surprising, as nobody expected the coalition to last particularly long in the first place; in fact, some were surprised it lasted as long as it did after the hurdles it came up against while combating the NPP. However, even if some sort of paradoxical resolution could be found, who was to say there would not be another one come the next election or even before that? In the interest of keeping the peace and respecting the democratic tradition of the country, this seemed the more sensible option."

 NPP_collapse.13.t:0 "At the Bottom of the Sea"
 NPP_collapse.13.desc:0 "In a surprise outcome, Ronald Reagan successfully used his power and influence within the new influx of NPP-N congressional members joining the Republican Party to make his moves against the Democratic nominee for the seat at the Presidential Office.\n\nDemocrats from both houses have lambasted their coalition's effort to propose a candidate that both sides could agree on. In addition to the increasing polarization between both parties, the Democratic Party members have thus agreed to eliminate the coalition between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. Even more, the Democrats have immediately thrown their support behind the moderate Democrat Jimmy Carter in an effort to foil Reagan's position.\n\nRepublican leaders have stated that they feel nothing short of utter betrayal by their Democratic counterparts, yet still feel confident with their new nominee for winning the presidency. With the race for the presidency coming to a boiling point, Democratic leaders also believe that, given the circumstances of the split, Reagan stands no chance in the polls this November.\n\nWhen asked for a comment on the situation unfolding, Presidential nominee Reagan stated that he believed the health of the nation had never been under greater threat from the forces within and without, adding that the inability of the former Democratic-Republican Coalition to provide any meaningful legislation or policies in the past has tarnished America's reputation across the world and he wishes to rectify this wrong committed against the country."

 NPP_collapse.14.t:0 "The Republican Offer"
 NPP_collapse.14.desc:0 "Strom Thurmond had endured enough throughout the previous month, as his patience was beginning to fray under the pressure. He watched in horror as the once powerful and influential Nationalist Party slowly began to crack and crumble, unbeknownst to others but not himself. The Nationalists would not hold for much longer, and he was finally beginning to acknowledge the necessity of immediate action.\n\nHe walked into a dimly lit office. In the chair opposing him was Senator Rockefeller, albeit lacking his signature blue coat, only wearing a white striped buttoned-up shirt and red tie.\n\n"Senator Rockefeller, good evening." Strom greeted the bespectacled senator.\n\nRockefeller's head snapped up. "Hello, Mr. Thurmond." He stammered for a moment, wondering why he, of all men, would even wish to sit across from him. "Take a seat, will you?"\n\nStrom did not bother with small talk. "Look, Rockefeller, my party is hardly holding together, and I am here to make you an offer." Thurmond's mouth creaked into a forced grin; he could see Rockefeller becoming more and more interested as he nodded.\n\n"I want to merge the Nationalist Party into the Republicans. As long as you grant me and my boys some concessions, we will gladly merge our manpower into yours." The two men discussed the topic back and forth at length but found an amicable agreement that the two would strive to make this merger work. As Thurmond shook Rockefeller's hand and left, the Republican senator held an expression akin to a child who had just been told he was about to get a jawbreaker."

 NPP_collapse.15.t:0 "Making the Switch"
 NPP_collapse.15.desc:0 "It was a momentous event. Cameras flashed around him as Rockefeller put pen to paper on the integration of the NPP-N into the Republican Party. The tight negotiations on various matters, such as representation and integration of the different party apparatuses, took months to hash out all the details. The most significant negotiations, however, were on the NPP-N's widespread support for segregation. Rockefeller could still remember the heated arguments during the hours-long meetings, discussing all the details about the merged party's policies on segregation. His own support of civil rights was well-known by Thurmond and the rest of the NPP-N, and it would likely always be a source of contention within the now-merged party.\n\n"Well, not always," Rockefeller thought as he suppressed the urge to smirk. Thurmond was getting on in age, having served in politics since 1947. While certainly impressive, it surely left him on the verge of retirement. Nobody else within the NPP-N had the will or charisma to capture an audience like Thurmond could and will for his remaining days as a spokesperson for the party. Once their main figurehead was gone, the segregationists could be assimilated and reduced to be nothing more than dogs without a bite. Only the most extreme of segregationists would remain defiant, but that would turn into a minor issue. Soon enough, Republicans could finally embrace the Rockefeller Republican moniker that had long since been used against him.\n\nRockefeller's thoughts about the future were halted as he shook hands with Thurmond across the table, symbolically putting the final nail in the coffin of the NPP as cameras forever immortalized the moment in the history books and journalists furiously scribbled their notes to report on later. Both men stood up on the podium side by side, standing united as a new Republican party that could cover all aspects of American conservative thought was born; a Grand Old Party that was hungry to prove the merger's worth to the populace and the electorate."

 NPP_collapse.16.desc:0 "It was evening, and the sun was halfway beneath the horizon, casting an orange glow across the town and into Claude Pepper's office. As he gazed out his tinted window, hands clasped behind his back, he released a weary sigh before resigning back to his desk. The NPP-P had been deteriorating in every way; every report showed fewer members, fewer donors, fewer volunteers, and everything else a political party would need in order to maintain a healthy existence.\n\nAnd of all times, too. He had been the first relevant progressive candidate since Teddy Roosevelt, but now he knew he was the elder statesman of a party now dying in slow, agonizing pain. Everything, from the Nationalist betrayal to the once-dormant, now-roaring Democratic party machines in urban areas to even major schisms within his own party — oh hell, Claude had to get back to Scoop on that affirmative action proposal before next Monday or risk him throwing a fit in the Senate — was working against him. It was clear that the NPP-P was not long for the world, even if Pepper couldn't come to terms with it.\n\nBut there was a solution, even if it meant fracturing what was left of the NPP coalition.\n\nHe would contact the Democrats and lead what remained of America's progressives loyal to him back into the fold, united under change so that he could once again work to inspire change from within. Despite this setback, Claude believed that while he still had some members, donors, and delegates left, influencing the direction of the Democratic Party from within was still possible.\n\nAs his mind raced away, he pulled himself up once more to leave the office, as dinner arrangements had been made by him earlier that day in silent anticipation. It would be better to begin the process tomorrow equipped with a rested mind and full stomach, as well as some precious time to contemplate what exactly to say and do. He could not, and would not, debase himself or his supporters."

 NPP_collapse.17.desc:0 "Richard was a seasoned House Republican; having kept his position for two back-to-back presidencies, he had acquired the ability to gauge the ebb and flow of various issues, topics, and trends. None, however, was quite so concerning as this which he was seeing here. Over the course of the last four months, the Democratic Party had become increasingly polarized, seeming to move incrementally further to the left, and this was beginning to reflect in their rhetoric.\n\nThe usual progressive policies and talking points were there, but soon to creep in were the tendrils of the more radical. One conversation he had overheard was a Democrat senator speaking in favor of communes and co-operatives and how that could reflect in their economic policy. He had no doubt that more talks of the like were being shared in back rooms.\n\nHe gathered his colleagues to host a joint meeting with their Democrat counterparts to address this issue. Did they simply not notice the influence spreading through them like cancer? Or were they the cyst that let it grow in the first place? A dozen men filed into the conference room and took their seats. "Gentlemen, my colleagues in the Democratic Party," he opened formally. "We have called this meeting to raise a concern that myself and others have noticed over the past several months. To get right down to it, we have noticed a trend of steady polarization among Democrat members. I would advise that this be investigated, lest it endanger the coalition."\n\nOne of the Democrats present, a senator, considered his words for a long moment before opening his mouth to reply. "While we appreciate the due concern of our Republican colleagues, we do not at this time believe it necessary to conduct any sort of investigation. Frankly, what would we do? What do we look for? Whom do we question? Any sort of inquisition would create undue tumult within our ranks," he explained. Richard sighed."

Eventually, as the initial shock had subsided, anger swelled.\n\n"They can't do this!" One of them shouted at last. "We had a perfect, absolutely sensible candidate lined up, and they put this nobody in his place? Are they out of their damn minds?" he ranted.\n\nAnother man raised his voice next. "This is the last straw. If they want to sink this country then they can sink their own damn party instead! We can't let this stand!" he thumped the table, causing it to rattle. All present agreed, and the sentiment rapidly spread.\n\nWith fierce admonishment, what some thought was inevitable finally came to pass. The Republican wing of the coalition nearly unanimously banded together to dissolve it. The righteous indignation among them did not end there, though. With Romney appointed as their candidate in order to oppose Kennedy, they hoped to keep a conservative influence upon the nation.\n\nThe Democrats were not wholly surprised by this, only that it took this long for them to throw their tantrum like a small, spoiled child turning on the waterworks after not getting their way. The people had chosen Kennedy for a good reason, outside their backward and reactionary ways. No matter. Their destructive bout of political pouting would prove for naught come the election."

This decision has proven to be a final nail in the coffin for the Republican-Democrat Coalition, as the Republicans accused the Democrats of dominating the Coalition and purposely keeping the status quo in their favor.\n\nA few days after the RDC Convention, the Republican Party officially announced they would be splitting their separate ways due to the fact that the NPP was no longer a real threat, and it was time to stop pretending the old pact founded all the way back in 1959 had any real use in the modern day of 1976.\n\nSeeing as the NPP is severely weakened, it appears that the newly reestablished Republican Party will be the one to nominate the new second major candidate for President. It is currently undecided who they will put forward, as many names have already been put forward, none even coming close to a safe majority to secure the nomination despite many calling for party unity to win these elections.\n\nIt is clear that the old system of the status quo has finally fallen, and Jeane Kirkpatrick will face monumental opposition and challenges to her presidency this November with only the support of the Democrats behind her."

One could hardly say he has received the nomination of the entire coalition, however, as it practically has been dissolved as a result.\n\nBayh, a Democrat who was chosen to be Chep Morrison's VP in the aftermath of President Hart's cancer diagnosis and resignation, was nominated due to his work against the repeal of the URI plans made by Hart. It appears that for the Republican Party, this nomination has seen them reach their limit with the coalition.\n\nIn an emergency meeting of the RDC National Committee, Republicans made demands as high as removing Bayh from the ticket altogether. When Democratic leaders denied their requests, the Republicans stormed out of the conference room, saying to press members waiting outside that it was their intent to dissolve the "unreliable and failing coalition that has become outdated from nearly 20 years ago."\n\nBayh has made a public plea to the Republicans urging them to reconsider this "hasty decision," but it appears they have no intention of returning to the RDC. It seems that Bayh will only have the Democrats' support to lead him along to the White House and continue the legacy of the late Hart's dream."

 NPP_collapse.21.hart.desc:0 "Ever since President Hart first pushed for and ratified the Urban Renewal Act in an effort to stave off economic stagnation and improve the situation of ordinary people, the Republican wing of the coalition had planned from day one to erode the act and eventually repeal it in its entirety. The Democrats, however, were acutely aware of this. This situation had led to the asinine game of chess with Republicans trying to chip away at the legislation versus the Democrats propping it up.\n\nThe act formed the fulcrum of both sides' campaigns, with arguments flying back and forth about how good, evil, progressive, and destructive it is. Some of the more spirited groups even issued pamphlets on how to counter the other sides’ rhetoric. Which of course caused another round of pamphlets on how to counter the rhetoric held in the previous edition. But once the delegates had settled on their votes and the dust had settled, Ted Kennedy was chosen by a comfortable margin as the nominee.\n\nThe Republican reaction to this was absolute outrage. All of their efforts to get the delegates, members and campaigners to see sense and get their heads out of the clouds had been rendered utterly and humiliatingly for nought. The decision was quickly agreed upon and enacted to unilaterally dissolve the coalition, as they could not stand to be stuck with another party that would sleepwalk the country into economic ruin. They view the URI as a venomous lotus fruit that needs to be cut down and crushed.\n\nIt’s needless to say that the URI, just like FDR’s New Deal, is exhaustingly divisive in the chambers of congress and its very existence is already a topic of discussion for the current election and will be for the ones after. Ted Kennedy has vowed to keep the URI intact and add more to aid the average American citizen. On the other side of the aisle, Reagan promised to continue the fight against government overreach, heavily insinuating that Hart’s URI would become a target on his list should he be voted into office."

While popular among Democrats, his victory over the Republican candidate has caused quite a stir in the RNC. Almost immediately, impassioned Republicans called for an end to the coalition due to the nomination of the 'radical' Kennedy.\n\nOnce a vote on the decision to split from the coalition was held, many in the room began to cheer and applaud as the Grand Old Party had officially split from the Republican-Democrat Coalition after a vote confirming unanimous assent for the separation. Members of Congress began to scramble in preparation for the coming fallout as Republicans celebrated what is now being dubbed as the 'RDC Divorce.'\n\nWhile many analysts viewed a split as inevitable after the fall of the NPP, this split largely comes down to Kennedy being an adamant supporter of a more progressive form of healthcare, which has earned him some ire among his own party and much worse from many Republicans. To combat Kennedy’s 'radical' policies, the Republicans have nominated Charles H. Percy. A fairly recent addition to the Senate from Illinois, the business-friendly Percy stands as a stark contrast to the progressivism of the young Kennedy. With both parties having selected their candidates, only time will tell who will come out on top in November."

While this may come as a shock to many out of the loop, for several analysts who predicted a Republican nomination due to the malaise of the Democrats in recent months, it is anything but. The conservative wing of the coalition viciously came after the late President Hart’s agenda with a newfound zeal not seen since the days of Nixon.\n\nThe unholy alliance of Republicans and Nationalists proved to be the left’s nightmare made manifest as they successfully repealed nearly all of the URI, dismantling all that Hart and his entourage had toiled over the course of almost eight years. This has, in the most generous of terms, left Democrats in a downward spiral, as they are unsure of how to proceed after Morrison’s calamitous tenure.\n\nNow, with the nomination of Reagan, the Democratic Party has officially left the coalition in a desperate attempt to keep the conservatives from further dancing on Hart’s grave. However, picking their own candidate is easier said than done, with Ted Kennedy and Birch Bayh left tainted with the failure of stopping the desolation of Hart’s URI. The indecision between the two has led to the nomination of Jimmy Carter, a candidate with a more fresh-faced and center-focused policy that the Democrats hope will be able to acquire goodwill for the many disillusioned leftists and perturbed moderates alike."

Nothing more than empty rhetoric had come out of Schlafly's tenure, and now they stood on the verge of an ignominious defeat at the next election that would lead America into the hands of excessive government access that would destroy the very foundations that they had fought so hard to preserve.\n\nAnderson sighed as he stepped away from Schlafly on the podium and disappeared backstage. Anything else said by Schlafly in that press conference would be exactly the same as her presidential run — empty promises. It had always been a gamble for him to work with someone with such little political experience, one he regretted more and more each day. Schlafly was uncontrollable within her brief time as president, and all she had accomplished was the destruction of the NPP-N's popularity. The White House had been turned from an office that demanded respect to a mere playground for the Schlafly family and their dinners. He could still faintly hear her deranged rant about the FAAI act. He had been dumbstruck, refusing to believe how deluded she was, but she continually proved she was unqualified for any office, let alone the presidency.\n\nWithout his own political connections, would Schlafly even have gotten this far? To discredit and contort every value he stood for on the grandest stage?\n\nHe needed to get away from this. It was the only way to salvage his own dignity from this travesty. He might be laughed at when he crossed the hall to rejoin the Republican Party due to his association with Schlafly's disastrous tenure.

Ever since his inauguration as president, the NPP-N had backstabbed their coalition, defecting to the Republican Party en masse even with his election victory. Jackson turned away from the peaceful spectacle to face the ancient, resolute desk that had faithfully served many presidents before him. A bulky typewriter rested on the desktop, taunting him with the prospect that he would not be able to see his vision of America come to fruition.\n\nJackson took a seat behind the desk and began to type out a speech. The constant sounds of clicks and clacks filled the empty office as thoughts about the speech's content bounced around Scoop's mind. Should he strengthen his resolve about the future of America? Should he explain why he had failed to keep the party unified and doomed the NPP to face an electoral landslide against the Republicans? No, it needed to be more simple than that. Nobody would want to hear his reasoning anyway — they would just take note that he had failed. Jackson continued to slave away at the typewriter for what felt like an eternity, a short speech acknowledging his one-term presidency was inevitable and that he would not be seeking re-election. It was full of standardized procedures and language, the fire that once existed at the start of his presidency now gone to the chilly East Coast breeze that he had grown all too familiar with.\n\nJackson sat staring at the speech that had been ripped off from the typewriter. Rereading the speech, he found it to be too automated, his once passionate rhetoric about the military and welfare toned down to the point that it could be used within a textbook.

Reflecting on the past few weeks, he had come to the crushing conclusion that it had all been for naught. His ascension to the presidency had been heralded as a new era for America and its people, only for it to be snuffed out by the same system he had promised to fight against. His plans for a budget, without the needed appeals of the self-aggrandizing politicians in Congress, were dashed by the hands of the rats in the Supreme Court, who loudly complained that his veto was to be “unconstitutional”. The broken system of the United States had united in time to suppress his vision of an America that would uplift the people and the people only. The bourgeoisie would never accept someone other than one of their own corrupt puppets.\n\nThe torrents of whispers from his staff speaking of an incoming impeachment process had arrived at his ears. The coalition lay in tatters as the moderates within the NPP-P fled in droves to the same party they pledged to stand against. Despite his current thoughts weighing heavily on his mind, Hall allowed a pained laugh to escape from his mouth as the sheer irony of the situation warped his thoughts. The same people who had promised to bring unprecedented change to the United States had turned tails and ran back into the arms of the same puppet masters that spat them out in the first place. Their words proved to be little more than venom to the working man's mind, enslaving them to the system and tricking anyone who sought to fight against it!\n\nHall remembered the beginning of his brief tenure as president, where his inauguration speech had once inspired cheers so loud he could hardly hear himself speak. Now, complete apathy reigned from the general populace as the system had stood strong against his assault. Aside from a few token reforms, he had fallen at the first hurdle of his revolutionary reconstructure; he had failed as a president. The reactionaries within organizations such as the FBI would be allowed to stay and continue to manifest their rot. The bourgeoisie would continue to profit from the capitalistic nightmare that plagued the everyday lives of the working class.

The extremely controversial support of a few organizations and public figures formerly affiliated with the NPP Communists have caused a PR disaster for the party as well, with recordings of left-wing militias inciting political violence broadcasting nightly to the general public.\n\nUltimately, the convention voted in favor of Jimmy Carter, a comparatively conservative Southern Democrat with a focus on civil rights, with centrist Walter Mondale as his running mate.

Liberals, moderates, and conservatives alike were absolutely horrified by not just the shocking actions and rhetoric of the President but also the massive — if temporary — support such an unabashed fascist had gained among the American public.\n\nThe pendulum had swung the other way, seeing massive public support for the heir to the Kennedy brothers' past. Ted Kennedy, an experienced Senator with a long history of advocating for the causes of social justice, universal healthcare, and immigration reform, had assumed the new face of the American left, drawing in a big tent of supporters from the former allies of the NPP Progressive caucus and establishment Democrats. Despite feeling he was not ready for the responsibility, Ted ultimately stepped forward out of a feeling of duty toward his country and his causes.\n\nAlongside his running mate Frank Church, a noted progressive and environmentalist, Ted secured the 1976 Democratic nomination for President, seeing widespread success in primaries and among superdelegates.

A former film actor and newcomer to the political scene, Reagan had skyrocketed to the top of every primary ballot, easily riding the wave of name recognition and the energized American right. 'Never Again' became the rallying call of his campaign, as he pinned the blame for Hall's presidency on federal overreach, communist infiltration, and suffocating bureaucracy.\n\nNaturally, Reagan was practically crowned nominee at the Committee, alongside his more liberal running mate Richard Schweiker, who was picked to peel away some moderates from the Democrats.

No article is untainted by the hands of this judeo-bolshevik conspiracy that stands against us and the implementation of national socialism within this country. But now that the conspiracy is exposed, we can strangle the perpetrators behind this conspiracy directly.” declared Yockey as he stood up from his chair, his arms resting on the sides of the desk.\n\n“I will override the degenerates within Congress using their own machinations against them. They will crumble against the vanguard when their pathetic attempts at stopping us are vetoed away. Their own methods of promoting cultural retardation being used against them will be an unprecedented shock to the Judeo-Bolshevik conspirators as they see their own system crumble in front of them. They will be exposed as the disease behind the American psyche to the masses, and from there, our stronger will to power will trample them like the vermin they are!” Yockey ended with a shout, betraying his previously calm demeanor, while Vice President Byers sat back in awe."

 NPP_collapse.35.t:0 "The Defiant American Will"
 NPP_collapse.35.desc:0 "Yockey stared at the brown paper file that lay dormant on the desk in front of him. Fumbling with the seal and hesitantly pinching the lofty white sheet inside with his thumb and index finger, he discarded the brown file onto the dark blue carpet underneath his chair. Scanning the itinerary of the pitiful single-sided report, his eyes darted to the one sentence scrawled upon its flimsy surface.\n\n“The Supreme Court has refused the reinstatement of Executive-Order 9066 stating its unconstitutional characteristics-”\n\nThe President's countenance was riddled with confusion, then molded into horror and eventually turned to anger as he vigorously shredded the paper with his hands and dropped the pieces to lie next to the brown paper file that the damning report was born from. He was supposed to be the President, the wisest and most authoritative figure in the whole of the United States! Yet here he was, being undermined by some pervading, meddling revisionists in the Supreme Court and the recent treacherous defectors from the NPP-ANV. They were supposed to lay their heads low and bow down to his authority so that he could safeguard the sacred qualities of Western Civilisation, but no, they had to subvert his decisive actions in the name of their liberal rubbish, and now they were coming after him. Yockey's time in the White House was over, and he knew it.\n\nThe President of the United States of America sat down and reached for the rotary telephone on his desk and, in an irregular tempo, punched in ten digits into the keypad before crumpling in his chair, awaiting a response.

 NPP_collapse.36.t:0 "Out with the New, In with the Old"
 NPP_collapse.36.desc:0 "Footsteps echoed throughout the empty hallway as Joseph headed further into the building. Various delegates throughout the NPP-P had called for a meeting to be held in Minneapolis to address the recent announcement that Margaret Chase Smith intended to run for a second term as president. She had always been a controversial face for the NPP, and Joseph mentally prepared himself for a meeting that was likely going to last for hours.\n\n“Smith has worked with the nationalists too much for us to consider backing her. How many of our reforms were stunted because of those damn hicks? The Economic Security Act could've covered everyone in America if it wasn't for their complaining about federal overreach.” stated Joseph's colleague, Gerald, as he entered the room, unnoticed by the other delegates as they grew interested in Gerald's words. “Not only that, but what of Americare? Something that should be accessible to every American is instead limited to only the elderly thanks to the Nationalists' stranglehold on Smith.” continued Gerald. The delegates' talks were forgotten as they digested his rhetoric.\n\n“That's why, gentlemen, I propose that we nominate Scoop again as the presidential candidate. He has continually put the interests of every American first, and I have no doubt -” Gerald's impassioned speech was abruptly interrupted by another delegate called Frank.\n\n“Again? We're already treading the nuclear tightrope with Japan with Smith's saber-rattling. Jackson would strangle the Japanese ambassador if he could get away with it!” he said, breaking the gusto of Gerald's speech for the rest of the delegates.\n\n“Would you rather we submit to Tokyo?” Gerald barked back. “They wouldn't trust such an absurd shift in foreign policy overnight. Scoop would enable us to achieve domestic equality for every citizen and keep the Japanese on the back foot.” Gerald finished as some delegates cheered his rhetoric on while others voiced their displeasures. Joseph buried his head in his hands, his prediction of this meeting taking hours coming back to haunt him."
 NPP_collapse.36.a:0 "And Joseph would be proved right."
 
 NPP_collapse.37.mcs.t:0 "The Incumbent's Failures"
 NPP_collapse.37.mcs.desc:0 "“This is getting ridiculous. She was already a lame duck, and now she’s courting the progressives, too? For God’s sake, please don't joke about her bringing the Marxists in — she might just do it,” Henry complained. An ad hoc meeting of NPP-N delegates had been called at their usual meeting place, which he and his fellow colleague had been invited to.\n\nThe colleague, James, mulled on his reply for a long moment before answering. “Y'know, I've been hearing about someone who might be able to help with that. A ‘paleoconservative’ they’re calling her, the kinda strong hand we need.” he said, trying to bring Henry out of the gloom he was in. “Phyllis Schlafly is her name, certainly turning a lot of heads in our camp.”\n\nHenry did not seem entirely convinced. “I remember people saying that kinda thing about Smith, how sensible and experienced she is. The kind of leader to run a tight ship,” he said mockingly, aimed as much at himself as her supporters. “So what could this Schlafly do to get us on track?”\n\nHis friend leaned forward over his plate. "I was on the horn with another friend of mine earlier. One of the policies they’re talking about is tightening up welfare. A lot fewer leeches on the system that way,” James explained enthusiastically, seemingly earning his friend’s attention. “Even have a few campaign slogans being batted around, 'Schla-fly me to the moon,'" he continued with an amused twinge in his voice.\n\nHenry looked to have recovered from his melancholic reverie by now, seeming well and truly interested in the words of this new and rising conservative. “Mmh, that feels like a little bit of a stretch. How about, 'Phyllis is with us!'” he suggested before both men began to discuss the finer details of campaigning and planning for this new candidate. But one thing was for sure — the status quo was becoming increasingly fragile."
 NPP_collapse.37.a:0 "The wheel continues to turn, despite its creaking."
 
 NPP_collapse.37.t:0 "The Rising Paleoconservative"
 NPP_collapse.37.desc:0 "“It's disgusting!” rumbled a portly, middle-aged man with an NPP-N pin on his lapel, slapping his open palm against the large, round table. “Harrington is a Red! That's pretty damn obvious, but that weasel and his followers always hide behind the guise of being moderate while they poison our country from the inside out!” he ranted, face turning as red as the mug of tea sitting in front of him.\n\nHis younger counterpart positioned next to him nodded solemnly. “I really don't know how he'd lead us against both the Germans AND the Japanese at the same time when our military is being completely neglected! How long do we have to wait before we're plunged into another all-out war and don't have the means to actually fight it? We're a paper tiger thanks to him!” he groused, arms folded tightly to his chest.\n\nThe third man in a neat pinstripe suit leaned forward, fingers laced together on the table. “Gentlemen,” he said calmly, “we can either sit here ranting and raving all day, or we can do something about it.”\n\nThe older man raised an eyebrow, turning to pay attention. “What are you saying we do? We can't exactly start a civil war here.”\n\nThe suited man shook his head gently. “Nothing as crude as that. You see, there's a real rising star in the NPP-N, a woman by the name of Phyllis Schlafly,” he explained, placing a dossier on the table with a picture of her clipped to the front. “Have a read of this, a strong and sensible conservative. Exactly what we need.” The two other men leaned in, reading the document of policies and opinions with rapt attention.\n\nThe younger man nodded tentatively. “I... think I can get behind this. So come the next primaries, we get Ms. Schlafly here the nomination, and she gets us on the straight and narrow?” he inquired. Both men looked up to meet the gaze of the suited man."
 NPP_collapse.37.b:0 ""Precisely.""
 
 NPP_collapse.38.t:0 "The Crack in the Pact"
 NPP_collapse.38.desc:0 "Sunrise is the most certain thing in nature, all could agree. Imagine, then, midnight at noon — when the great ball of light in the sky should be at its brightest and warmest, and yet only the cold darkness of a new moon night remains, condemning all beneath it to cold and hopeless shivering. Delegates of the Progressive wing of the NPP had been listening to the radio. The mood of jubilation in the room before the announcement had all but vanished, the laughter dead in their throats.\n\nAfter several long minutes, the news report transitioned into sponsored messages and advertisements. The sort of stuff and nonsense one could safely ignore, and one of the men present finally broke the morose silence which sat like an impenetrable fog amongst them. “I don’t believe it,” he croaked, knuckles white from clutching his bottle of beer. “Those goddamn bastards... they fu-”\n\n“They betrayed us,” one of his friends present interrupted, with slightly more force in his voice. “The pact, who’s too afraid of change, and the voters who don’t know what’s good for them. They’ve just thrown the election in the trash, all for this senile old hag!” he growled, slamming his own drink down, flicking several drops of liquid around, before planting his face into his hands.\n\n“If they betray us like this, all bets are off,” the next man chimed in with finality in his words. “The Democrats look like they have a decent candidate. We’re never gonna get what we need out of the NPP, and I, for one, am sick to death of being strung along.” He stood up. “Who’s with me?” he cried out, trying to shake the others out of their funk."
 NPP_collapse.38.a:0 "The approval was unanimous."
 
 NPP_collapse.39.mcs.t:0 "Same Old, Same Old"
 NPP_collapse.39.mcs.desc:0 "Schlafly sat in disbelief as Margaret Chase Smith announced the NPP's continued confidence in her leadership of the party. It was never supposed to be like this; they had exposed all of Smith's pathetic practices in her campaign. The failure of her 'silent revolution' that promoted women to abandon the fundamental structure of the family in favor of being bought in by the libber propaganda sprouted from the spineless elites. All it had accomplished was the systematic atrophy of the very traditions set out by the founding fathers, leaving the poor women brainwashed into believing the libbers' lies.\n\nSchlafly stood up and smothered the edges of her dress as she turned to leave, not wanting to hear any more lies regurgitated by the Eve of America. As she began to walk towards the exit, Schlafly recalled how the liberals and communists of the Progressives, whom Smith often compromised with, constantly sought to sacrifice brave American sons to the hands of foreign freeloaders who would laugh at America's eagerness to kill off their population while they relaxed at home, utilizing the American media as propaganda to promote senseless internationalism and further their own interests at the expense of America’s dignity.\n\nIt was then that a grim realization struck Schlafly as her hand rested on the doorknob. The NPP had proven itself to be infested with communist and fascist sympathizers. Even her direct actions had not been enough to prevent the further destruction of the Founding Fathers' wishes. She'd have to return to the Republican Party in hopes that some sense could be found within American politics. It would take time to redeem herself from her foolish defection from the Republican Party. Perhaps, in due time, she could regain the party’s trust. Then, when the libbers' conspiracy to control America was exposed, and the people recognized their constitutional birth rights were being tampered with by the hands of the New York kingmakers, she would smile at their downfall as the Republicans swept into power and the natural order of things was restored."
 NPP_collapse.39.a:0 "She turned the doorknob and left, never to return."
 
 NPP_collapse.39.t:0 "A Rising Star Felled"
 NPP_collapse.39.desc:0 "Schlafly sat in a state of disbelief as Harrington climbed up onto the podium. Scurrying like a rat, he announced his renomination as the leading candidate representing the NPP in the near election. Despite her campaign, the sniggering political elite had once again snubbed her conservative rhetoric, with those four years having been enough time for Harrington's dangerous ideas to sink their claws into the corpse of her party.\n\nShe believed that America’s situation would have changed for the better, but her defection from the Republican party had now proven completely pointless. The hands of the suffocating Democrats who sabotaged Goldwater at the 1968 elections were no different from the hands of the NPP Progressives; both did their best to choke America and drag its corpse into violent conflicts abroad, watching as their sons died for the whims of Washington kingmakers who sought to make America their puppet laughing at its willingness to dance for them.\n\nSchlafly glanced up at Harrington. Having previously tuned out of whatever drivel he had been spouting, Schlafly refocused back onto the speech to hear Harrington's continued promises of moderation within the party to uplift the 'Other America.' Schlafly huffed. This rhetoric only sought to violently shake the social fabric of America, and it was already proving to be recklessly dangerous. It had already reshaped the NPP to its whims, infecting its delegates with a sickness that only a few would acknowledge. Those who did back Schlafly looked up to her as a savior from the hands of communism, but it was too little too late.\n\nSchlafly rose from her chair as Harrington's speech concluded and abruptly started to leave. She did not need to hear any false apologies from the snakes within the NPP. It was clear what she had to do regardless of her contempt for the concept. A return to the Republicans. The Republican Party was the only party that was able to recognize the value of martyrs like Goldwater. Schlafly acknowledged her past mistake in defecting to the NPP and understood that she might never receive another nomination due to her betrayal. Nevertheless, she resolved to return to her home, committed to guiding those who would stand against the vile kingmakers in Washington."

Millions of Americans have lined up at school gymnasiums, libraries, civil centers, and fire stations across the nations to fulfill their civic and democratic duty. This year marks the 48th quadrennial Presidential Election, but there will also be 15 state and territorial gubernatorial elections to decide governors, 33 Senate seats, and all 435 seats in the House of Representatives, and many other local and state elections for mayor, councillors, sheriffs and judges all across the nation.\n\nHowever, the Presidential Election is what everyone is tuning into the TV and radio to learn about as the polls are closed. As the night goes on and the votes are counted and reported, it soon becomes clear who will soon be sitting in the White House for the next four years..."

Status quo or radical upheaval, it's time for the people to decide!\n\nThe Republican-Democrats and National Progressive Pact, along with numerous third parties, are gearing up their political machines across the 50 states, with special focus going to those Senate seats up for grabs. Tens of thousands of volunteers, campaign staff and candidates are gearing up to begin the primaries, rallies, whistle-stop tours, public speeches, glad-handing and debates that will dominate the nation's attention for the next few months. Issues of great importance will be debated, candidates will be scrutinized, and eventually millions of voters around the nation will get the chance to make their voices heard. And the greatest Democracy in the world will once again prove itself.\n\nAmidst the chaos of the unraveling NPP, however, the Republican-Democrats have found themselves increasingly at odds and have chosen to conduct separate election campaigns. It seems that after two decades and three presidential elections as a coalition, the fate of the country will once again rest in the hands of the elephant and the donkey."

 SWRW_USA_skeleton.1.desc:0 "Today, in the streets of Miami, Florida, chaos was the word of the day as tensions were simmering before the NPPNC convention was held. Rioters, both inside and outside the building, protested the decisions that the NPPNC was making. With a total of three protestors killed, hundreds injured, and an unknown number detained, the night has been described as one of the most violent protests seen in American history.\n\nFrom inside the convention center, delegates from across the country chaotically threw and withdrew their support from a wide range of presidential candidates, with various splinter factions dividing up the entire party. For a moment in time, it had seemed as if the entirety of the NPPNC had just collapsed in on itself, but eventually, a candidate was chosen and the convention concluded."

 SWRW_USA_skeleton.2.desc:0 "Scoop Jackson confirmed yesterday in a press conference that the Progressive Party has come to an end, with the party set to become reintegrated with the Democratic Party once again, following several months of quiet negotiations between Jackson and Hubert Humphrey.\n\nThis news comes as no surprise to many, citing the growing distaste in the coalition, consistent lack of electoral success for the party, and the overall decline in support as a source of grievance for many party members, some calling it inevitable and others, especially in the Nationalist sect of the NPP, calling it a "brutal betrayal to the true believers of America." Although the NPP-N has proclaimed to stand in defiance of this great defection, many observers cannot see the coalition staying afloat by the next year."

Following the effective collapse of the NPP as an electoral force, both the Democrats and Republicans have struggled with the influx of new ideologues on the left and right, respectively, and party leaders ultimately found that attempting to salvage the coalition was "no longer feasible," although it was made clear that the Democratic Party had initiated the split.\n\nThe two parties that have dominated the political spectrum since the mid-1800s will now face off again. For the Democrats, the focus now turns to whether they will be able to regain the electoral dominance they maintained over the Republicans from 1948 to 1956. Only time will tell."

 SWRW_USA_skeleton.6.desc:0 "Earlier this morning, the President of the United States, Gus Hall, announced that a budget had been drafted and approved, intended to go into effect immediately. In a press conference following the announcement, Hall clarified that he had bypassed congressional approval for the budget, citing the process's antiquity as the primary reason. The budget is the centerpiece of intense debate, both within Congress and in the general public.\n\nAlthough Hall has a small but vocal base in Congress, Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill has stated that they will not recognize the budget as legally binding. Hall has already made it clear he will contest this decision, and the Supreme Court is preparing to convene to make a decision."

 SWRW_USA_skeleton.7.desc:0 "Gus Hall has announced his resignation from the office of President of the United States. Hall found himself in trouble with both Congress and the Supreme Court earlier, due mainly to the passage of his congressional budget without any input or agreement from Congress. As such, it appeared highly likely that had Hall not resigned himself, Congress would have voted to impeach him, ejecting him from the office anyway.\n\nAs Hall's Vice President, Paul Robeson, resigned just two days ago, the office of Vice President is currently vacant. According to presidential succession laws established by the Presidential Succession Act, the next-in-line for the Presidency is Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill, who now faces the enormous task of unifying a populace shattered by three years of communism."

The order, originally instituted during the Second World War, allowed the American government to relocate Japanese Americans to internment camps without trial.\n\nJapan has already released a diplomatic statement harshly condemning President Yockey for his "blatant racial discrimination against Japanese people living in the United States," and it has resulted in widespread protests from both the American populace and many notable political leaders. Many influential congressmen have declared they will do everything in their power to block the order."

Hundreds of militants and supporters of the President have attempted to stop the impeachment, but to no avail, as the National Guard swiftly restored order.\n\nCongress charged Yockey and his Vice President, Louis T. Byers, with high treason, acting against the constitution, and collaborating with enemies of the state. However, with his trial coming before that of Byers, Yockey managed to flee the Capitol before the start of his trial. Due to his disappearance, Byers was arrested and taken into custody, with an arrest warrant out for Yockey. In Byers' stead, Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill has taken the role of Acting President — a role which is surely soon to be made permanent."

Amid a watchful crowd, President Romney vowed to continue his path of moderate conservatism while emphasizing the importance of unity after the collapse of the Republican-Democratic Coalition.\n\nRomney's body of work so far has remained popular amongst the public, but with the RDC gone, nobody remains on the other side to truly oppose him. Where Romney goes from here is almost entirely up to him, with some already predicting a shift rightwards now that he no longer answers to the Democrats."

The Democratic leader has once more defeated her rivals, this time in the born-again Republican Party, to win four more years as President.\n\nKirkpatrick's second term looks set to be a straight continuation of her first. She has vowed to continue her strong brand of interventionism in a global show of American strength and to build on liberal values at home. How much Kirkpatrick can achieve in her second term, however, is no longer restricted by the Republicans but simply by how far the Democrats wish to go."

The former actor turned California governor utilized the recent exodus of acquainted NPP-N defectors to the Republican Party to secure his position as the lead candidate for the presidency.\n\nReagan’s election marked a grand departure from Republican traditions that have gripped the party since the Second World War, with a strong focus on American interventionism as the leader of the free world and cultivating the image of the centerpiece of American values in the face of unchecked and chaotic world change. It remains to be seen if Reagan will be able to successfully lead America under the newly galvanized Republican Party."

The election of Baker has left many stunned and others relieved; Baker was a compromise candidate between the two more outspoken wings of the party and used his stellar record of bipartisanship effectively in his campaign for the Oval Office.\n\nNow that he is President, Baker wishes to improve the transparency of the government and regain the people's trust, which was fully lost at the end of the Nixon administration but has not truly existed in the Republican Party since the early days of President Dewey. Only time will tell if the people of America are held as close to Baker's chest as he says they are."

A more liberal member of the Republican Party, the youthful senator from Illinois has differentiated himself from his Republican counterparts by consistently ignoring traditional Republican voting lines in favor of his own conscience and pragmatism. Percy's public perception improved greatly on the campaign trail; some publications went so far as to call Percy "the Republican Party's JFK" due to his youthfulness and charisma.\n\nIn his inauguration speech, Percy promised that he would return the nation to Liberal Republican policies inspired by the Dewey Administration. Although such an approach has been opposed by more hardline Republicans in Congress, many people look to Percy as a beacon of hope for the next four years."

 SWRW_USA_skeleton.15.desc:0 "Jimmy Carter has officially been sworn in as President of the United States. Originally a dark horse candidate, Carter's popularity skyrocketed after the collapse of the RDC, being seen as a moderate force able to appeal to independent voters. Carter's election represents the resurgence of Southern Democrats as a political force and also marks a sharp turn in favor of pacifism for American foreign policy.\n\nCarter endured one of the more unusual paths to the presidency in American history. After a stint in the Navy, Carter turned to peanut farming, where he operated a successful business before running for the Georgia Senate. Despite being in a southern state, Carter became a civil rights advocate, eventually turning his eyes to the governorship, where he served until his presidential run."

 SWRW_USA_skeleton.16.desc:0 "The Democratic Party has returned in full force, with Birch Bayh being sworn in earlier as President of the United States. Bayh's rise within the party can be attributed to his steadfast belief in social reform and influence within the Senate. Having championed civil rights and gender equality throughout his entire career, Bayh accepted the Democratic nomination after his successful introduction of 'Title IX,' which made him a symbol of change overnight.\n\nWith the United States still reeling from the explosive end of the RDC coalition, it remains to be seen if Bayh's ambitious goals of electoral reform and further civil rights legislation will be fulfilled by the time he leaves office. In the meantime, however, the Democratic Party can look forward to four years of solo governance."

The youngest brother of the current Kennedy generation, Kennedy enjoyed a successful career as a Colorado Senator before riding the Progressive Party influx to the Democratic nomination.\n\nIn his inauguration speech, President Kennedy passionately spoke about the need for healthcare reform and his work with House and Senate Democrats to pass universal healthcare. However, the newly inaugurated President has a tough road ahead of him, facing both Republican opposition and the looming specter of his late brother casting a shadow above him. Despite all of this, the President is highly capable of meeting — or even surpassing — the lofty expectations placed upon him."

 SWRW_USA_skeleton.18.desc:0 "In a highly shocking and unexpected political development from the United States, Birch Bayh has announced that the Electoral College will be dissolved before the 1980 election. An attempt to change the electoral system has been seen as more likely over the years, but such a bill was deemed to have an extremely low chance of success due to Southern opposition. Bayh moved quickly to finalize his victory, shepherding its ratification through the required 38 states to confirm the constitutional amendment.\n\nSome have welcomed the move, believing that this would level the playing field and make politics more fair. Others are more critical, saying that this will open the door for political strongmen to muscle in. One thing is for sure, however: the American electoral system has irrevocably changed."

 SWRW_USA_skeleton.19.desc:0 "Following the reinstatement of the two-party system in the 1976 presidential election, members of Congress sought to avoid a return to the chaos that plagued the elections of the late 1950s. Their attempts to solve this issue eventually led to the introduction of a bill replacing the Electoral College with a two-round system by Senator Birch Bayh. However, while it passed the House convincingly, the bill failed to overcome a Southern filibuster.\n\nConservatives across the nation have applauded the outcome, with some saying that their nation’s leadership will not be dictated by "urban mob rule." Senator Bayh made a statement proclaiming that he will continue to strive for electoral reform for a "broken system." However, it seems that his dreams of electoral reform are dead, at least for now."

The continued advocacy of Schlafly, alongside the apathy of current President Ronald Reagan towards the amendment, proved to be enough to deny the amendment's passage.\n\nWith the law now declared formally dead, investigations have opened to look into any potential foul play or buying-off that has occurred due to widespread protests by women's rights organizations. As of today, there is no official statement from the White House regarding the movement's failure."

Despite President Schlafly's repeated public remarks about the role of women in everyday life, nobody anticipated her brazen move to repeal one of the most recent achievements of the civil rights movement.\n\nImmediately following the veto, various members of Congress from both aisles banded together in a show of bipartisan support to override the veto. Prominent senators denounced Schlafly’s attempts to repeal Title IX as unconstitutional, while in what some consider an act of solidarity and others an act of spite, Senators from the RDC and NPP-P drafted a bill to further strengthen the civil rights law, which is expected to fly through the Senate."

 POLITICS_JIMMY_CARTER_DESC:0 "They say that a good man cannot be elected President. Though not without flaw, Jimmy Carter may yet prove them wrong.\n\nBorn in Georgia as James Earl Carter Jr., Carter's humble beginnings and modest living have shaped his platform of populism and unique brand of liberalism informed by Christianity. Despite his personal convictions straying from the Party line and making him appear to be a political outsider, his time as a State Senator and later Governor of Georgia have lended him a long history of experience in both the executive and legislative branches of government. Within the Democratic Party, Carter represents the emergence of a more dovish faction; while by no means soft on the Reich or on Japan, he has worked to place more emphasis on humanitarian goals and foreign aid.\n\nNow, having finally made it to the Oval Office in spite of the odds being stacked against him, Carter's Presidency has already created a sense of change. The cold pessimism that once racked Washington is slowly being swept away, in its place a warm air of cautious positivity. The only question is whether Carter can balance his better natures with the hardships that accompany the Commander-In-Chief. For if warm air clashes with a biting wind for too long, even the best of intentions can create a perfect storm of malaise and stagnation, one that could ravage confidence in the White House for years to come."

Edward Moore Kennedy bucked this unfortunate trend.\n\nTed Kennedy hails from a dynasty of senators, representatives, mayors, ambassadors, and, of course, a president — his brother John F. Kennedy. The Kennedy dynasty has always held some power, but many believed since he was the youngest, he would fade into obscurity. Ted persevered through these doubts. Like his brother before him, he would go to Harvard University, inevitably studying law at Virginia University. While helping his brother by working on his political campaigns, Ted fell in love with the state of Colorado, moving there and eventually running for Senate in 1962. He fought for healthcare, welfare, and labor rights inspired by his brothers. Ted would endure the tragedies that befell the Kennedy family and found time in this period to flourish politically. He became known by his peers as the ‘Lion of the Senate,’ chairing committees and possessing a stranglehold over many pieces of legislation.\n\nWhen the 1976 election came around, he ran for president and won. No longer was Ted just the leader of the Senate, the younger brother, unknown. He was President of the United States. Following in the footsteps of his brothers, he would fight for the people, hoping to bring America into a new age of prosperity. Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is time to get down to business."

The decorum in Congress has been shattered, and the man left to pick up the pieces must now ride the waves of the collapse of the NPP. The United States of America is in an unprecedented crisis, and, for better or worse, the only man who can change the situation is O'Neill. In a position not even the founding fathers could fathom, O'Neill — affectionately known as 'Tip' — must reconcile the national spirit of America, lest he let it fester and corrupt the national consciousness.\n\nBorn in North Cambridge, Massachusetts, O'Neill graduated from Boston College. Following a short stint in the Massachusetts House of Representatives, he would be elected to the nationwide equivalent in 1952, soon becoming the protege of fellow Bostonian John William McCormack.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Tip O'Neill would soon move up the House's leadership, eventually becoming Speaker of the House. However, with the impeachment of his predecessor, he has been hastily inaugurated as interim president. The turmoil the past administration wrought will force him to tend to the very fundamental ideals of the Union. His administration, a coalition of Republicans and Democrats, must quickly bring decorum back onto the Senate floor and undo the past four years of damage."

An ally of 35th President Estes Kefauver, Bayh championed civil liberties and was instrumental in the passing of both the Kefauver-Cellar Antitrust Act and the landmark 24th Amendment, which abolished racially discriminatory poll taxes. With Bayh introducing both Title IX and the 26th Amendment, it elevated his status in the Democratic Party, rapidly becoming an icon of social change in the eyes of America.\n\nBayh now serves as the President of the United States, an advocate for constitutional reform. He is dedicated to tackling the discrimination and injustice that exists within the system, championing civil rights and gender equality as he hopes to free America from unchecked radicalism and prejudice. His naivety and farmboy demeanor might be apparent to some, but to his supporters, Bayh's inclination to defend the American people makes up for it.\n\nFor Bayh, the American Dream must go on forevermore."

His dedication to former President Hart's agenda was rewarded with the Democratic nomination and, eventually, the presidency.\n\nBayh now serves as President of the United States. Given his experience as VP and charisma at campaign rallies, this hardly comes as a surprise to loyal Democrats and even the opposition. Bayh has already shown he is a determined man — and one at that who will ensure that, alongside his own agenda of electoral reform, the vision of Hart and Chep is seen through in their entirety."

 USA_Ronald_Reagan:0 "Ronald Reagan"
 POLITICS_RONALD_REAGAN_DESC:0 "Though it may come as a shock to those who first knew Ronald Wilson Reagan as the Republican nominee for President, the former Governor of California was once a staunch Democrat. During his time in Hollywood, Reagan was a champion and ally of the AFL-CIO, Screen Actors Guild, and President Franklin Roosevelt. However, by the time of his election to the Governorship, Reagan's political leanings had made an almost complete shift.\n\nAs Governor, Reagan had worked to reestablish himself as the candidate of law and order, pro-business policy, and tax breaks for the average American. His rise to prominence as the leader of the GOP in the years since can be attributed to his innate and powerful charisma; his moving, yet honest speeches and appeals to American exceptionalism lit a fire in the hearts of the working man, proud Christian, and suburbanite alike.\n\nNow, as President of the United States, Reagan and his election to the Oval Office represent a marked departure from the conservative tradition which has defined the Republican Party since the end of World War Two. Now is a time for choosing, and the American people have let their choice be known: the era of 'big government' is over, and in its place will stand a new movement founded upon Christian values, a military made to make the Wehrmacht cower, and a nation made great again, with Reagan and his cabinet at the helm."
 
 USA_Charles_Percy:0 "Charles Percy"
 POLITICS_CHARLES_PERCY_DESC:0 "The Republican Party has represented many different things to many different peoples throughout its history. In the decades since Lincoln, some have sought to reshape its very essence into a force for division, for bigotry and hate, and for an agenda set with no mind to the wishes of the American people. President Charles Harting Percy represents the complete and utter rejection of these goals, and a shift towards moderate, responsible conservatism.\n\nPercy first began his political career as an Illinois Senator, inspired by the goals and values of President Eisenhower and New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller. All throughout his time in the Senate, he defied any preconceived notion of what it means to be Republican, consistently voting according to his conscience, not the whims of party ideologues. While the radicals of the GOP railed against the Civil Rights Act, Percy worked to secure affordable housing for lower-class Americans and sensible, pragmatic foreign policy.\n\nThat devotion to bipartisanship, civil rights, the working poor, and America's interests across the globe has stayed with Percy all the way to Pennsylvania Avenue. His success and election to the office of President is a beacon of hope, not just to the country, but the ideal of a Republican Party not defined by hate, or by malice, but by striving for a better tomorrow through cooperation, compromise, and unity."

 POLITICS_HOWARD_BAKER_DESC:0 "There comes a time in every nation’s history when it needs a firm but experienced hand, when both internal and external plights may make any other inexperienced young man panic and add fuel to the fires. Howard Henry Baker Sr. is not that man. Howard Baker, one of Huntsville, Tennessee’s favorite sons, has proven his political mettle from the start, having roots that start from his father’s time in the House of Representatives.\n\nAfter graduating from Tulare University in New Orleans, Howard joined the Navy during World War 2 and became a lieutenant. After coming home, he would pass the bar and begin his law practice. Although his political career would begin rather shakily, losing the 1964 Senate election to Ross Bass, he would bounce back in 1966 and become the first Republican Senator in Tennessee since the Reconstruction era and the first to be popularly elected to the Senate from Tennessee. Baker would soon be known as the “Great Conciliator” — renowned for brokering compromises, enacting legislation, and always keeping civility.\n\nThe 70s have been a tumultuous time for both America and the world. Be it reeling from the Oil Crisis or Eastern Europe being set alight in the Second West-Russian War, the globe has been rocked in one way or another. America will weather this storm of a decade, with Baker resolute at its helm."

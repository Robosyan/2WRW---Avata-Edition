 Deutsch_Willy_Brandt:0 "Willy Brandt"
 POLITICS_DEUTSCH_BRANDT_DESC:0 "Herbert Ernst Karl Frahm was born December 18, 1913 in the city of Lubeck. He had a peaceful early life, finishing his Abitur and helping his single mother and step-father through the economic hardships of the thirties. However, it wouldn't be long before the Nazi specter of hate and destruction fell under Frahm's homeland. During his time in hiding to avoid persecution by the Gestapo, he adopted the now famous pseudonym of Willy Brandt.\n\nAs years passed and the Nazi shadow eclipsed not only Germany but all of Europe and the world, Brandt felt a calling to rise against their jackboot, and after years of silent opposition he came to lead the underground resistance movement of Reichsbanner §qSchwarz§!-§VRot§!-§wGold§!, a surviving remnant of Weimar era opposition to Nazi rule long thought defunct. From the Reich's loneliest villages to its vastest cities, his movement faced the Nazi wolf head on and resisted its deathly bite. All those of Reichsbanner lost and suffered to those that worshiped the crooked cross, knowing their cause was too sacred to abandon.\n\nWith the Nazi party in disarray following the calamity in the East, Brandt and his allies have assumed power and triumphed over the specter of hate. Now he, at the head of a new Germany, must lead her into a new age of government, for the people and for three, simple, principles:\n\n.\n\n§qEinigkeit§!, und §VRecht§!, und §wFreiheit§!."

 reich.2000.desc:0 "As the tides of war shift and the Eastern Front sees a radical turn of events, the German High Command finds itself facing a formidable ultimatum from the Slavic horde. Their government has delivered a set of surrender demands, backed by the losses in the east. The situation in the Reich is dire, and a decision has to be made."

 reich.2001.t:0 "The Russians Surrender!"
 reich.2001.desc:0 "As expected, the Slavic hordes of the east have been routed. Their pathetic armies, crushed beneath the marching boot of the Aryan soldier. Unfortunately, those barbarians are preparing their nuclear weaponary and are preparing to attack. For the safety of Germany, we should approach their government and gain favourable terms of surrender before they plunge the world into darkness."
 reich.2001.a:0 "Tell them we want everything up to the Urals. Nothing less."

 reich.2004.desc:0 "Our Fatherland, having once emerged victorious from the Second World War earning us the title 'Master of Europe', is now anything but and we have found oursleves in a catastrophic downfall. A resurgent Russia has managed to defeat the Nazi regime, forcing Germany to relinquish its colonies in Eastern Europe and plunging our country into economic despair. As the nation teeters on the edge of total collapse, a quick decision must be made regarding its future leadership. Will Germany's current Führer of Germany and leader of the NSDAP remain in power, or will a new leader rise from the ashes of defeat? The choices are stark, and the consequences will shape the destiny of the shattered Reich."

 reich.2005.desc:0 "Finally, after countless months locked in a bloody struggle for the fate of Europe with an intensity not seen since the Second World War, we have once again triumphed over the Eastern threat. Through strength of arms, our Reich has forever proven to the world that we are the rightful masters of the continent, as the German people proudly celebrate our victory and the boots of the Wehrmacht march all the way up to the Urals.\n\nTo our east, our defeated foes splinter and fragment, spiralling further and further into anarchy as the newly declared Bundesrepublik Russland prepares for a refugee crisis of massive proportions. Both the Organization of Free Nations and the Co-Prosperity Sphere stare on in awe of our triumph, the balance of the Cold War irreversibly tipped in our favor for the forseeable century. And in the Einheitspakt itself, our strength and prosperity reaches new heights, with the woes of the Oil Crisis and Slave Revolt finally away into history.\n\nWe may not know what the coming years will bring, but we can be certain we will march torward it with confidence and strength, for the sons and daughters of Bismarck have learned that the great questions of the day are not achieved with speeches or majority votes..."

 reich.2006.t:0 "Eine Schwere Krone"
 reich.2006.desc:0 "Gerard Klopfer unbuttoned his collar as the heat of his office reached unbearable levels. He wiped a layer of sweat from his forehead and reached for his scotch. The ‘Master of Euope’ poured the copper hued liquor into his glass for what must have been at least his fifth. The drink burned his throat like molten slag. Klopfer let out a heavy sigh before looking toward a map that showed all of Europe; his empire. Or rather, what was left of it. Klopfer gripped the neck of his scotch bottle as he thought of everything he gained being taken away by those Slavs and their Jewish puppet masters. In a flash of anger, Klopfer threw the bottle, shattering it against the ornately drawn map. Its contents dripped down the parchment like blood from a wound.\n\n“Gehlen, Heusinger, Waldheim...” he muttered under his breath before joining the names with terms like ‘Jews’, ‘traitors’, or ‘Russian spies’. They were all conspiring. He knew it in his very soul. His own cabinet. His own confidants. They saw the writings on the walls. They smelled blood in the water, his blood, and were scheming to feast on the proverbial corpse that was the position of Führer.\n\n“You slav-fucking traitors... All of you!” He screamed out before violently sweeping away all the papers, pens, and telephone equipment that littered his desk. The loud clattering did nothing but infuriate him more as he began to deconstruct his office in the most violent fashion possible. It was never meant to be this way. He was supposed to assume Bormann’s position, lead the Reich into a new golden age, and cow the fat American capitalists and avaricious Japanese bankers. Not even he could have predicted that the Russians would come out of their caves and destroy it all. Now all he had left were table scraps, and even now those scraps were turning against him. Bolsheviks and democratic movements ran rampant in his streets, almost harkening to the days of the Weimar Republic. Klopfer needed another drink to get rid of that thought, before remembering that his cure was plastered against his ruined map.\n\nHe pulled open one of the drawers in his desk. There he moved his pistol and case of cyanide pills aside to pull out a picture of Martin Bormann. His mentor, his role model, his Führer..."
 reich.2006.a:0 "Klopfer wished he had never met that man."

 reich.2007.t:0 "Saving Germany"
 reich.2007.desc:0 "Brandt took a deep breath, trying to calm the nerves scratching their way through his heart. Around him, his hastily constructed headquarters deep within Berlin buzzed with activity. All were focused on one simple goal: saving Germany. This was the moment he had been waiting for after so many years. So many horrors had been committed in the name of the Reich, and so many men and women had died at the hands of his own countrymen to serve the ideals of a madman. Now, he had the chance to begin fixing the mistakes of the past, if only he had the courage to seize the moment. And seize it he would.\n\n"Are our men in position?" He looked over to one of his lieutenants, and when he saw the nod, he felt... what did he feel? Anger at all the atrocities? Or was it fear, fear that this wouldn't work out? That somehow, Klopfer had caught on and that he would escape justice? Brandt didn't know. All he did know is that they had no other choice. "Tell the men to begin."\n\nAround the city, militia commanders were handing out their commands. They would be seizing key sectors of the city, taking control of barracks and communication centers, and most of all, they would be securing the Volkshalle. Brandt had to remind himself to breathe. These were the true sons and daughters of Germany, he told himself. They would see this through to the end.\n\nIt seemed an eternity before the lieutenant approached him once more. "Sir, I have a report from the field," He began. "We've secured all our objectives. The Volkshalle is under our control. Berlin is secured."\n\nBrandt breathed a sigh of relief as the tension left his body. They had done it. There were many difficult days ahead, Brandt knew, but with this single move they could begin deconstructing the rotten structure of the Reich and bringing democracy back to Germany. "Thank you, Lieutenant. Thank you all!" He raised his voice, speaking to those gathered. "Without your diligence and hard work, we would still be living under the tutelage of National Socialism. You are all heroes of Germany!"\n\n"Sir, there was one more thing," The lieutenant spoke up. "Klopfer has yet to be found. It's possible that he has somehow escaped the city.""
 reich.2007.a:0 "We will deal with him later. Today, hope returns to Berlin."

 reich.2008.t:0 "Rotting Foundation"
 reich.2008.desc:0 "The traitors had done it. They had ruined everything. As Klopfer stepped out of his plane, boots hitting the tarmac of Bavaria's airport, all he could think of was Brandt's face, smiling and laughing as he tore apart the Reich. His hands curled into fists as he swiftly made his way towards a car waiting to take him to a temporary residence.\n\nInside the car, he saw an aide waiting for him in the back seat. "Are you here to tell me that we're fucked? Because I already know that we're fucked. I want orders sent out for the men to start mobilizing."\n\n"Already done," the aide replied. "They have standing orders to shoot anyone who might show sympathies for Brandt's clique. Once their units are secure, they're to wait for orders from you to march on Germania and root out the traitors."\n\nKlopfer felt a bit of hope return. Yes, perhaps he did have a chance at recovering from this disaster. "Good. We'll crush these degenerates under our boots and put this whole 'democracy' business behind us."\n\n"There is one more thing, mein Führer. The chaos is not localized to Germania. There are reports of uprisings across the country. We're getting news of unrest among the Wehrmacht in the East, and there are reports of communists in the northeast."\n\n"Communists? Those Bolshevik roaches think that they can take advantage of our moment of weakness? We'll crush them. We'll crush them all. Hitler's dream will not die with me. I refuse to become the last Führer."\n\n"Yes, mein Führer. I will relay your orders to the men."\n\nAs the car began to make its way off the tarmac, Klopfer glowered out the window. Snakes were coiling all around him, snakes and traitors and roaches all hoping to feast on the dying corpse of the Reich. And it was on his shoulders to fix it."
 reich.2008.a:0 "He would save Germany, or die trying."

 reich.2009.t:0 "Freedom Rings"
 reich.2009.desc:0 "Willy Brandt stood before the crowd, a mass of Germany’s people. Not the murderers and the bandits who had decades before built an empire off the corpses of thousands, cultists to a dead god propped up in Germania. These were the farmers who had lost sons, the workers who had never known a day without the eyes of the Führer looking down upon them. These were the people who had suffered, who had lost their homes, their families, and their relatives in the war against the Russians. He had to inspire them to move forward. To move beyond.\n\n“My people!” Brandt called out. “We were told once that this Reich–this kingdom–would last a thousand years. That the Aryan would carry the banner of this Earth into a new age: an age of Germany. What has come of that age, my friends? The deaths of our sons? Our fathers? Our brothers? It is time to look to the heart of what has come to this land; it is not the Jew or the Russian who is the plague that has brought this land into turmoil. It is the Nazi! The Nazi has infected this land like locusts, gnawing away at the foundations of what made us good. Look at our leaders and what they would have us do, my friends. Is this what we have resigned ourselves to be? Monsters that the world speaks of in hushed whispers? There is no glory in that; there is no power in that! We were told that this land would be the envy of the world, and now it is only the envy of the past.\n\n"My friends, this entire Reich has been a lie. A lie that has been built on the suffering of all of us. Of men without faces laboring in mines and factories without hope; of men choked by the smoke that has come from their hovels; of men who have wasted away with a sickness and decay that infected their food or water. But there is hope. If we rise up, arm in arm, the Führer cannot stand against us. Not with his lackeys smelling his blood in the water, not wit-”\n\nA shot rang out. It rang through the crowd, crashing through Brandt’s speech like a rock against glass. He stopped speaking, and looked down to the fire that had begun to burn through his stomach, blood pouring out from the wound. Freedom had rung for all of Germany to hear. Freedom from the traitor Brandt."
 reich.2009.a:0 "He fired three more times before Brandt fell."

 reich.2010.t:0 "A Spark Of Outrage"
 reich.2010.desc:0 ""Deceived! Betrayed! We have been nothing short of misguided and misled by our so-called leaders! All of us!" A small crowd had gathered around a dock worker that stood atop a pier pole, declaring his rebellion against the National Socialists. "For believing their lies of secure stability is nothing more than an emperor without his clothes! You, the German people, are better than the ramblings of a mad man that is no longer even with us!"\n\nAs the worker kept stating his mind for all to hear, the crowd began to cheer on the man's resolve and vindication in his words. Feelings of slight but tense anger filled the minds of all who listened to the worker. Hamburg police forces began to slowly surround the man and his crowd, attempting to pull the group into the jaws of a trap.\n\nBefore long, another group of dismayed dock workers who were just fired en masse bolstered the ranks of the crowd that continued to listen to the man after, who now began to point at the police forces that had swelled to a couple dozen officers. Once more, speaking to the crowd he said, "See how they wish to dispose of us? They wish not to hear and listen, but to beat and suppress! To dominate us by their clubs and bullets! "Public Order", they say, in defense of so-called democracy. I don't believe it, and neither should you! No more shall we put up with these crimes! Justice, for us all!"\n\nThe outraged crowd descended upon the clearly outnumbered police presence, who, despite having no backup to call on, tried their best to hold their ground but to no avail. Dock workers and shipyard workers alike caused a scene of violence so intense that nearby onlookers themselves partook in the beatings of the officers. A few of them lay still on the street, while the rest of the officers fell back to their vehicles; the only option that remained was to leave. Celebrating their victory, the crowd hoisted the man who started it all on their shoulders, and began marching down the road, chanting in unison for justice to be reinstated across the Reich."
 reich.2010.a:0 "Things are getting out of hand."

 reich.2011.t:0 "Temporary Arrangements"
 reich.2011.desc:0 "A tired and weary Dutschke sat back against the wooden chair behind him, his face worn and aged despite being young. Hours had passed, yet Dutschke, Aust, and Hoffman could not agree on a single issue that each one posed. The day had come and gone for them, and all they were left with was one simple truth: they needed to free the German worker from the claws of the Reich. With an exhausted sigh, Dutschke returned to the conversation the three men were having.\n\n"We might not see eye to eye on the specifics of our goal, but at the very least we can rally around kicking out the fascists once and for all." Dutschke's eyes darted from Hoffman's to Aust's, receiving a nod of approval from both men. "Therefore, for the moment we will halt discussion on how to move forward with the revolution, and instead focus on fighting for the workers. That means aligning with the democrats, at least until the fascists reaction is dealt with." The room fell silent again as the words lingered in the air momentarily, the weight of it all bearing down on the three men.\n\n"This does mean war, Rudi. It means declaring our intentions and being willing to spill blood for it all." Aust said in a hoarse voice, his eyes staring off into space momentarily as the last words left his lips. "It will be a gamble, but it is the only chance we have at this. We can't back down now." Aust's voice grew confident in its cadence as he nodded once more at Rudi.\n\n"We can't let the opportunity for revolution leave us. I'll have my men take battle ready positions when this meeting is over. You two should follow suit," Hoffman said as he grabbed his coat and threw it on. He stood at attention and saluted the two men before making his way to the door.\n\nAs Hoffman exited the room, Aust and Dutschke sat quietly at the table, their minds still processing the situation unfolding before them. Aust was the first one to break the silence, as he stood he placed his hand on Dutschke's shoulder to bring him back to reality. "Rudi, you heard the man, we have to go."\n\nDutschke's dilated eyes looked up at Aust for a moment, then he slowly rose from his chair and grabbed his coat off the chair, carrying it with him as the two men exited the room."

 reich.2012.t:0 "The Veteran"
 reich.2012.desc:0 "It was a cold day in Königsberg. The war had never reached Germany, but the effects of the Russian victory weighed heavily in Ludwig’s home region. His Iron Cross did little to garner any respect or admiration from the people he had called neighbors before the war. He didn’t blame them, truth be told; what was meant to be the Fatherland’s finest hour against the Slavic hordes turned into everyone’s worst nightmare. Grief was in the air; it was in the eyes of the city’s residents, eyes that were too sunken and too tired to cry for their fathers, sons, and husbands. Ludwig almost wished he had been one of those fallen soldiers; it was better to be remembered as a fallen hero than deemed a living failure.\n\nHe never fell prey to them, but he heard the stories of veterans being harassed by mobs of angry residents once the news of defeat came. Ludwig himself was spat at by a veteran of the first war in West Russia when he arrived back to the city. The old veteran pointed at his Iron Cross and barked at him that a true son of Germany would never allow any of this to happen. That his failure would only have been redeemed if he had died in the face of the enemy. Ludwig just let it happen. Others blamed him for the "corrupt government" that had sent him there. All he wished was to finally see his home again. The home he grew up in, the home he would think back on when he needed to remember why he had to get up and keep holding his rifle.\n\nInstead of his home, what Ludwig found was decay and dilapidation. The residential block that housed him was taped off and boarded up. Ludwig read the nailed sign on the entrance: ‘This property has been purchased by IG Farben-Königsberg Division. All assets inside are officially company property. If you have concerns, contact the number-‘\n\nLudwig turned away in anger. After everything he had done, the nights he spent tossing and turning in the bitter cold while defending the Dnieper, the lives he had taken... All he received for it was a piece of medal on a ribbon. He had done so much for his country, and in return he was spat on, verbally shamed, and his own home taken away without a single shred of concern from the government he fought to defend.\n\nLudwig plucked the Iron Cross from his uniform like it was an overripe fruit. He looked at it with contempt before tossing it into the mud."
 reich.2012.a:0 "Germany has truly forsaken their sons..."

 reich.2013.t:0 "Lost Brothers..."
 reich.2013.desc:0 ""-as a result of unfortunate circumstances within the Republik, it is in our deep sorrow that we must postpone the distribution of your pension of fifteen-thousand reichsmarks. We ask you to wait for more official correspondence." Ludwig sneered as Kurtz read his letter out loud to the men sitting around him in the corner booth of a pub.\n\n"Wait, my ass." Kurtz scoffed before crumpling up the letter and tossing it away. Heinrich, a tall but skinny man, not even in his thirties, took a long drink of his beverage. "With how they’ve treated us so far, I’d rather go through the Katherinstadt defense again. At least then people like us were treated like people." The mood around the table was equally dour. All veterans, all outcasts from the society they had sworn their lives to defend.\n\n"I fought Ivan nearly to my last breath in Charkow. Earned my cross for it," Ludwig recounted to the group. "All I got in return was my home boarded up and nothing to my name but my fucking uniform."\n\nThe rest of the veterans had similar stories. Tales of valor and courageous; deeds in the name of Germany, all of which ending so similarly: destitute, betrayed, and cast aside. Reduced to men stripped of their sacred honor.\n\n"It shouldn't have to be this way.." Ludwig broke the dreary silence that hung over the men. "We did all these feats and more and for what, to be treated like seditionaries, saboteurs?"\n\nFriedrich, one of the veterans who kept to himself, finally broke his silence. "At least there’s one person out there that gives a damn about us." He reached into his coat and placed a small stack of pamphlets on the table. All of them including the same name.\n\n"Ferber?" Ludwig inquired, "Isn’t this the commander that aided the Moskau evacuation?"\n\nFriedrich nodded as he leaned further forward. "It’s all true. I should know: I was under his command when it happened." He pointed at the picture of Ernst Ferber on the pamphlet cover. "This is a man that hasn’t forgotten men like us. As the Russians took away all our grandfathers fought for, he kept us from losing hope. Right now, he’s fighting all he can to ensure men like us get what we deserve: pensions, homes, and respect. I say that Ferber’s our man. When the chips are down, he’ll ensure our honor is restored.""
 reich.2013.a:0 "The other veterans proceeded to ask where the next rally would take place."

 reich.2014.t:0 "...Now Found"
 reich.2014.desc:0 "Ludwig stood alongside his brothers in arms, all of them men who shared similar experiences. War may take away life, but it made kindred spirits. These men, who sacrificed everything and received nothing, now finally found a common cause. Every one of them took to the streets of Königsberg, chanting slogans that demanded their right of repayment of their service. Their right to be treated with respect. The protest drew attention from passersby as they marched down the streets. Most jeered, but some had looks of tepid sympathy.\n\nTheir protest was cut short as a column of military trucks drove toward their direction. They stopped several yards ahead of them, Heer soldiers filing out of each truck. The veterans murmured amongst themselves, most beginning to unholster their pistol and hold up their rifles. Ludwig was among them, his gaze piercing at the line of soldiers to the opposite of the veterans.\n\nA clean shaven and pasty-skinned young man stepped in front of the formation of government troops. "This is an illegal gathering! Disperse immediately, or you will be charged with insurrection!"\n\nThe aged veterans didn’t flinch. Ludwig took charge and stood in front of his fellow veterans. "How old are you, soldier? Have you even served on a front?" He shouted.\n\nThere was a silence before the soldier answered. "Twenty two. And... I haven’t had the honor." There was a stammer in the young soldier’s delivery. Ludwig’s lips curled into a dry grin. He reminded Ludwig of himself. He too had been a bright eyed youth seeking to prove himself. He wished he could’ve told this boy the truth, but he knew that time was long past.\n\n"Then what makes you think you can stand a chance with us if we refuse. All of us fought against the Russian devils, and they’d tear young boys like you apart as if they were culling crops!"\n\nThe veterans all readied their weapons and took aim. The young recruits did the same, but the experienced men could see the guns opposite of them shake.\n\n"You dare defy-" A shot rang out before the boy could finish."
 reich.2014.a:0 "The Veteran’s warning rang true as shots began to fire across the entire city."

 reich.2015.t:0 "A Fire Rekindled"
 reich.2015.desc:0 "It had been a few months since Antoni joined the fight, and already the brief spark of hope he had once held so close to his heart had begun to fade. However, standing atop a hill facing a checkpoint alongside a few others, something stirred. Whereas he held a spark, before him rose a fire. A fire not felt and not known since every Pole's first encounter with the system built to hate them. They all had stories of their own. Stories of abuse, so ordinary and mundane. Treated as if there was no alternative. As if this was life, now and forever.\n\n"All good things come to an end" went the phrase, but it never seemed just. Not to the Poles. Do only good things end? Would evil remain indefinitely? Ask the Germans burning and dying at the checkpoint from the Resistance's bomb. If one were to ask Bartosz such questions mere months ago his responses would have been painfully common. If one were to ask Antoni such questions mere months ago, his response would have been refreshingly rare. It made Bartosz sad to meet someone like that, for such hope was not meant to last in the world they lived in.\n\nAs they moved through the underbrush, they acted and moved as if man had returned to his roots, allying with nature itself. One shot was all it took, and at once, they moved from their earthly cover into the checkpoint. Yet Bartosz stood still, watching. Listening. Not to them, but to a radio. He had cursed the German language, and cursed it more when he had been made to learn it. He despised that tongue, yet what that radio said may very well have been the most beautiful words he had ever heard.\n\n"Chhh. Minor instability or civil war in the Vaterland? Chhh. Is this the end of the Reich? Chhh. Can the Einheitspakt survive?"\n\nWith that, Bartosz didn't know what to do. Muttering the translation just loud enough for his fellow partisans to hear, he couldn't contain himself any longer. He laughed as tears of joy began to streak down his cheeks. Antoni moved to embrace his friend as a feeling not felt in Poland for decades began to pierce the misery that had held their hearts prisoner for so long: a feeling of hope."

With the building barely intact, all Fritz Teufel could think of was the crashing of glass, the crackling of fire, and the cheers of exhilaration; to him, these were the things that one lived for, and as the adrenaline rushed through his veins, he knew that this was truly the end of the Reich.\n\nRegaining his bearings, he took to a spot in front of a now-dilapidated storefront, feeling an urge to speak to those before him. "Comrades!" He began, now faced with the stares of nearly a hundred, perhaps more, "See the fruits of our efforts laid bare! See the destruction of those who have wrought so much pain! So much suffering!" As he gestured towards a burning party flag, another wave of Zhdanov cocktails hit the building, dowsing it in a bright flame that even Teufel, a pronounced atheist, could only describe as holy.\n\n"They thought their empire of evil invincible. They thought it above the common people and those they spent decades doing nothing but exploit. Witness as their errors dig their graves, and watch the liberation of the working class occur before our very eyes." He paused, taking in a solemn breath. "Many have died for us to get here. Brothers and sisters of the revolution, struck down as if they were nothing more than prey to be hunted. But we are not animals! We are not prey! We are not revolutionaries; we are the revolution!"\n\nAs cheers engulfed the crowd, the building, one covered from foundation to roof with Nazi symbology, began to collapse. As the rotting foundation gave way to its burning superstructure, the rioters–now numbering well into the hundreds–let out one last hurrah as they began to fan out, spreading throughout the city and engulfing it in their wake."

They were arranged in clean columns before him like rows of wheat, except they did not sway in the wind like crops. They stood straight and tall. Proud. Above all, Lemm had taught them to be proud.\n\n"Men of the Freikorp!" He raised his palms towards them, as if to beckon them towards the future. "Our great Fatherland stands on the brink of destruction. Our corrupt leaders have squandered the greatness of our land to serve their own gluttonous desires, consigning us to defeat against the Slavic hordes which came knocking at our gates. They continued to stand idly by as the vile Judeo-Bolshevik virus spread among our own kin, corrupting them to follow the ways of so-called 'communism'. They have allowed the hedonistic liberals to take control; these so-called liberators hope to return us to the weak and despondent days of the Weimar Republic, and to squander what makes Germany great.\n\n"I stand before you and declare what every true German knows in their hearts to be true: our identity is on the brink of destruction. Enemies lurk all around us, and all seek to tear down this Reich for their own selfish ends. We alone can save Germany. We will stop the conspirators who plot the destruction of our race and our culture, who promise supposed freedoms which will only weaken us in our great struggle against our eternal foe, and who would rather see Germany burn for its supposed sins.\n\n"These corrupt politicians, these liberals, and these socialists are the true sins of our Fatherland, and they must be cleansed. Their blood will be the water of our nation's baptism, allowing it to rise again stronger than ever before. Let us end their corruption, one body at a time!" Lemm raised his hands high as he reached the glorious climax of his speech, and was answered with the cheers of the men who would save Germany from itself."

His voice trailed off.\n\n"Yes, but if you would please listen to my proposal..." Schnez replied, trying to soothe the other man's worries.\n\nNot in Bohemia, no. Not this time, thought Schnez. The protectorate will be safe and secure, and the men he gathered will be purely acting in self-defense and preservation. What little remained of the border defenses could be used, and many more will be constructed. The mountains too, are a solid natural defense. It all came together, to safeguard what little he could have.\n\nOnce again he set the phone down. Three more on his side, already at their posts and on strict guard. His troops would still be too meager of a force to stand up to any of the other factions, a fact all too obvious, but it would be all they had for the time being. If they have to fight, then they will fight. For what came next, Schnez slid onto the creaky old chair in front of his desk and put pen to paper to officialize it all."

Somehow, the Polish partisans he was tasked with exterminating had besieged the city of Waschau, his headquarters and head of the Operatinszone. With his dreams of victory collapsing around him shell by shell, he had decided his last mission to the Reich would be to escape and notify the Wehrmacht of his men’s shameful defeat, and god willing survive this hell the Slavic Untermensch has put in the Reich.\n\nAs the tired engine of his vehicle croaked alive, the Polish artillery grew closer to his headquarters. He glanced at the motley crew defending his encampment; these were the true sons of the Reich. Not the cowardly officers who disappeared inexplicably under his command, but the few men with whatever bullets they could scrounge from Warschau’s ruins. Weaving through the rubble and shoddily made defenses he came upon a column of soldiers, seeing one of his trusted officers leading the beleaguered men.\n\nEnraged, he threw his car towards the column, almost hitting the tired, young officer leading it. Instead smashing into a barricade, injuring himself. He weaseled his way out of the car with his pistol in hand, quickly positioning himself on top of his totaled vehicle before slicking back his messy hair. "You dare defy my orders? I am the head of this Operationszone and like fucking Judeo-Bolshevik weasels you run from the battle? How DARE YOU!" Every word uttered by Baatz grew in fury as the broken man pounded his pistol against his chest, his other arm flailing wildly.\n\n"We were to kill the damned Polish menace for the Reich, for me! For my victory! For my hour of triumph against the Devil spawn of Eastern Europe. Yet you run? You all deserve to die in the ruins of this damned cursed city for defying my orders!" His fury soon turned to the officer, the man he confided in: Siegfried. "And you... you traitor! You not only defy my orders but betray me and run! You deserve to be shot with the rest of the deserters here!"\n\nSiegfried calmly climbed the old, destroyed car and placed his hand calmly on Bernhard’s shoulder. "It’s over Brigadeführer...

The grave had his name inscribed, under which was a quote.\n\n“The day will come when the hatred that seems unavoidable in war will be overcome. One day, a Europe in which Europeans can live without fear will become a reality.”\n\nDietrich let a smile pierce through his steeled demeanor as gunshots cracked in the distant city blocks. Some partisans, Dietrich assumed. It wasn’t supposed to be this way, but here he was, in front of the grave of Germany's greatest hero turned martyr as Germany burned. It had turned into a nightmare to organize some semblance of a new leadership, but when the democratic movement finally did, it was already too late. When Brandt’s body was laid to rest, the grief that struck the nation turned to anger, not just for his followers, but for all of Germany. Deitrich thought back on all the calamities that piled onto, one after the other, as a result of the assassination. It seemed Brandt was the man who kept it all together; how else would all these dominoes have fallen?\n\nFrom the socialists taking arms in the west, Nazi loyalists in the south, and the disgruntled veterans that overran Prussia in the east, Dietrich and many others like him had much to do to make Brandt’s dream a reality. Democracy was the only true and just path for Germany. He knew this, as did millions. Despite all the death and strife that happened because of Brandt’s movement, Dietrich was determined to help ensure Germany walked the path that Brandt had paved before them.\n\nDietrich pulled out a rose from his jacket. Everything that led to this–the war with the Russians, the assassination, and the battles that were to come–it would all be worth it if it meant that all Germans could one day be free from the memory of Hitler’s lunacy. He clutched the rose as he prayed for that day to come, the thorny stem breaking through his skin, but Dietrich paid it no mind as he kissed one of the scarlet pedals and placed it in front of Brandt’s grave. The first rose of many, he hoped.\n\nThe months that will follow will decide Germany's fate, and there was no time to lose. He rose to his feet and put on his helmet, and marched toward the future."

All the folders and blueprints involved plans for his nation’s future. The only good they'd serve now would be as kindling for a fire. Speer thought it was over. After taking care of Schmidt and his other Jewish sympathizers, nothing would stand in his way. For a time, he was right. His reforms and plans were implemented perfectly. The people grew accustomed to his rule; things were stabilizing. But then a storm came from the east and swept it all away, like the tide washing away footprints on the shore. The tide came in the form of Russian steel and resolve, resolve to destroy any chance of hope and stability for Europe.\n\nSpeer recounted how he should’ve prepared. He should’ve stopped obsessing over the influence of Jews and instead focused on the true enemy. The Russians clearly plotted this from the moment he rose to office during the Burgerkrieg. Perhaps they contacted Schmidt and his cronies. Yes, it made more sense when he thought about it.\n\nAs he kept fixating on his new revelation, the door to his office opened, and in walked Kurt Georg Kiesinger, Ludwig Erhard, Henning Von Tresckow, and finally Helmut Schmidt, their ring leader and the man Speer despised most.\n\n"What are you degenerate Jews doing here?" He hissed, "I haven’t sent for you, so you better leave before I execute you all right here and now!" Speer pulled out his Luger from his holster and aimed it directly at Schmidt.\n\n"We figured you’d react like this," Schmidt said, paying no mind to the gun pointed at his head. Von Tresckow, meanwhile, failed to hide the snide grin under his mustache.\n\n"We’re here to do something we should’ve done a long time ago," The Prussian said. Armed soldiers proceeded to enter the office of the Fuhrer, their guns pointing right at him. As the last soldier filed in and took aim at Speer, a bespectacled man walked inside and stood next to Schmidt. Speer trembled and began to shiver in something he hadn’t felt in a long time: fear.\n\n"You too, Spiedel?" He mumbled out weakly as his gun was ripped from his hand."

The impassioned voice in his speech aroused every last person to audibly cheer for roughly a minute before Helmut was able to speak further.\n\n"Today, we will all take a step towards democracy within our German nation, and with it an extensive change in powers of the government. You, the people, will have a voice in the matter, something the previous regime had denied from you since its beginnings." Once again, the crowd cheered harmoniously, Helmut's ears ringing from the sheer volume.\n\n"The stain on our values left behind by the spiteful Nazi regime is a thing of the past. We are to do what is right and collectively step away from such an awful way of leadership." Silence filled the audience as a moment of remembrance swept across the faces of everyone, their eyes heavy with tense emotions.\n\n"Today, we will all take a step away from our past, and into the future that lies ahead for us; for we possess the reins of our fates, and together, we all can make a German nation forged by the people!

But truthfully, how could anyone predict this outcome?" Tresckow argued, sweat from the stress beginning to drip down his brow.\n\n"We couldn’t…" Schmidt said somberly. "We thought after dealing with Speer, we’d be untouchable. We didn’t even notice how bloodthirsty the Russians would be." It was true. Helmut felt naive thinking that the Russians would look at what he and his compatriots were doing and think that peace would be an option. Helmut didn’t realize how strong Russia’s revanchism truly was; it was nigh unbreakable.\n\nNow here they were, arguing and lamenting in an office that held a fog of cigarette and cigar smoke. With the loss of the Reich’s holdings, there was no way to relieve the hunger issue, the overcrowding, or the refugee crisis. Not to mention the parties in the Reichstag now turning their backs on them. They were paralyzed, unable to do anything but wait. Wait for the end.\n\nThey wouldn't have to wait long. As the sounds of trucks braking and doors opening and shutting entered earshot, jackboots stampeded into the building, and the Gang of Four shared looks of uncertainty and trepidation.\n\n"Where did we go wrong?" Kiesinger wondered out loud as he took one final drink of his cognac.\n\n"I don’t know." Helmut said. As he took a long drag from his cigarette, it brought him a vain sense of calm, before he snuffed out the stub onto the ashtray. "But what I do know is that I don’t regret what we did. Even if this is our last day, the people we freed from their shackles will remember us. We saved and gave back the lives of millions. That, my friends, is something Speer will never have over us."\n\nHelmut prepared to speak more, but the door was kicked open and armed men stormed inside. The Gang of Four held up their hands, their dreams dashed, but their spirits remained high.

"When those rat bastards took the leadership for their own ill-gotten gains, did you all think it was over then? It has never been over. We have the advantage again!" Speer declared, fists slammed onto the hard wooden table upon his proclamation.\n\nThe unbearable silence of the room drove Speer to contort his face in a mix of anguish and rage, his berating of all the others filling the halls of the Volkshalle for all to hear. It was only until a nervous soldier had arrived into the room that Speer had stopped his dribble of rage. Speer's face turned to a face of defeat upon learning the news from the soldier that Hans Speidel had surrounded the city of Germania with his own units from the military. Once more, he demanded his allies ready themselves for the skirmish that was about to ensue, and made his way to the door of the meeting room.\n\n"We have no soldiers to fight with. They all either defected, or threw down their arms." Those words had stabbed Speer directly into his heart, the breath leaving his body momentarily. He slowly turned around to look back at his apparent allies, all of them looking directly into Speer's face. The shock and terror on Albert's face was the only external communique he could illustrate for all to see.\n\n"It's over Albert. The military has agreed to the terms Speidel offered them, and in exchange all they have to do is disobey your orders. There is no returning to how it was before–only the end for you." One of the generals stood up, drew his pistol and pointed it at Speer, and motioned him to face the wall. As he complied, another general had decidedly handcuffed Speer's wrists together."

But that was only right- life is struggle, even at the end. To struggle for life is glorious, a noble duty, an unimaginable honor. The others never understood that. Speer, that whimpering schoolboy, never accomplished anything other than playing with bricks and stealing Adolf's attention with useless blueprints. Goebbels and Göring capitulated to degeneracy even before the war. He remembered how they'd whimpered, begging the race's savior not to invade Poland, terrified of British bombers flying over Berlin. And Himmler- that snake! In the end he'd proven himself the mongrel Bormann always knew he was.\n\nOnly he had kept the faith. Only he had the strength to follow in Hitler's footsteps. And now look where he stood- master of Europe, no, master of the world! The crowd before him was roaring, begging him to speak. Even as his body failed, his mind was strong. Klopfer has tried to convince him to stay inside, the cunt. There were no other words for it. Even now, he was paving the way to succeed him, using the Führer's advancing cancer as an excuse to consolidate his own power. Truly, the man had no loyalty. But the people understood that he was still in control, even at the end. It was his words they begged to hear, his words they turned on the radio to hear, not Klopfer's. He would never be his equal. No, only Adolf was his peer.\n\nWaldheim stood at the podium now, shouting some vague nonsense into the wind. Bormann remembered years ago, when he'd dragged the lanky bastard out of the shit-ridden bowels of the Foreign Ministry to replace von Schirach. He made a mental note to order Gehlen to do away with him.\n\nWaldheim finished his speech, and thrust his hand to the right. "Now, brothers and sisters of Germany, I give you: your Führer!" Bormann hobbled towards the podium, wincing in pain. He couldn't keep his back straight, or walk with much more than an aching shuffle. He reached for the podium-\n\nAnd lost his balance.

 POLITICS_GERHARD_KLOPFER_DESC: "What is there to say about Gerhard Klopfer? If Bormann saved the party, then Klopfer will reap the rewards of his efforts. He took power with little commotion, brushing aside both Gehlen and Waldheim in a succession that was more an anointing than a power struggle. Klopfer prepared the party, and himself, for his leadership since the second wave of purges following the June of Deceit, and any dissenting voices had long since been silenced.\n\nBut after all that it has been through Germany finally seems idyllic. Europe knows the face of National Socialism by now like a old friend: cruelty, order, and a system of cutthroat bureaucracy that appoints men like Klopfer to a positions higher then most men can could dream of. The new Führer's solution to the socialist terrorists, if they even really exist is to shoot anyone he suspects of treason; his solution to the ongoing economic crisis is to double down on autarky, double down on sacrifice, and double down on the copious bribes he sends out like clockwork to mantain the party above all.\n\nIt is clear that Klopfer is no radical. He is no Himmler. There is no reason to break a well-oiled machine at this point. The system will continue, and those lucky enough to be in the right circles will grow richer. No, the true horror of Führer Klopfer's reign is that National Socialism has become an institution in Europe. The murder of thousands, the rape of entire countries, and the extermination of cultures has become utterly, indescribably, boring. The bloody concert of Europa must not end, and as long as he draws breath he will ensure it plays for another thousand years."

Germany doesn't need an ideologue. She needs a man devoted to the good of the German people, willing to place his nation before himself. She needs a noble man, someone willing to conduct the racial symphony of National Socialism in a new era. She needs Reinhard Gehlen.\n\nAt least, those are the words he repeats in public. In private, Gehlen has been a distant supporter of Bormann since his victory in the Civil War, exterminating his enemies with poison and sniper bullets and working around the clock to consolidate the state's power. His agency, the Strategische Unterstützungspolizei, proved its loyalty during the June of Deceit when it delivered Heinrich Müller's head. Thus, when the RAF began its campaign of terror, the Führer in all his wisdom appointed Gehlen to eliminate the stain of dissent. Gehlen used the OrPo like a conductor's baton, slicing through the noise of deception and treason, silencing the untuned instruments and producing the sweet music of peace. Amidst this period of reorganization, no one noticed when a few of Gerhard Klopfer's allies left the concert hall, or changed their tune ever so slightly. Now they, and the NSDAP, sing Gehlen's praises instead. But it is he that holds the baton, he and the OrPo, not the party. Never the party. Never again the party."

He was drafted into the Wehrmacht in 1941, and served as an interpreter, propaganda officer, and liaison throughout the Balkans. Waldheim rose to the rank of Oberleutnant, and was awarded the Medal of the Crown of King Zvonimir by the Independent State of Croatia.\n\nAfter 1945, Waldheim joined the German diplomatic service, where he served first as a liaison with the Ustashe government. After Croatia fell to Italian influence he served in a number of posts, including as a military liaison to Finland during the West Russian War and later as Ambassador to Sweden. After Baldur von Schirach's removal, Bormann appointed him head of the Auswärtiges Amt, believing that the aristocrat-populated Ministry would reject a commoner's leadership, leaving the rebellious ministry powerless. However, with Klopfer and Gehlen at each other's throats, Waldheim was able to consolidate a power base of industrialists, diplomats, and party members slighted by Bormann's brute leadership.\n\nEver the diplomat, Waldheim's first act as Führer was to begin a series of détente conferences with the Japanese and Americans. However, he shows no sign of easing the yoke upon the Slavs of Eastern Europe.

Originally a simple infantryman, by 1938 he took up the post of Operations Chief of the Wehrmacht, and later was promoted to Chief of the General Staff. However, it was during the West Russian War that his star truly shone, as Heusinger's forces were one of the only army groups to perform in any adequate manner amidst Field Marshal Schörner's failure. During the Civil War, many expected him to side with Göring. However, he ultimately ordered his forces to enter Germania under Speidel's command, where he stayed for the remainder of the war.\n\nAs the situation in the East deteriorated, Heusinger organized a National Socialist aligned insurrectionary group among the military. Calling themselves the Schnez Truppe, this faction of former SS, disgruntled officers, and patriots chose to coup Bormann's successor when it was clear that their government was collapsing. With the party in tatters and the military fully behind him, Heusinger has had little difficulty in seizing power, simply ordering the assassination of any officials who speak out against him.

From the climatic final days of the Second World War to the chaos of Operation Suvorov and attempted Shutzstaffel Coup, Schmidt has seen the Reich steer from the Uncontested Hegemon of Europe to the Master of Nothing in the span of half a century. From an Empire to last a thousand years, brought down to its knees by those thought less than human, Germany has been left a smoldering ruin. Left a flaming waste by those who guided it towards the fire.\n\nNow it is Schmidt’s turn to steer the Reich into a changed world, and he has no intention of staying on its current course. Backed into a corner by all sides, the Gang of Four have showed their fangs in the face of yet another catastrophe. Except, this time they have no intention of “reforming” the National Socialist model. Instead,  Germany will be Schmidt’s own Ship of Theseus. One by one, each and every rotten plank that makes up the monstrous, bloated Reich will be torn down, built anew in the image of a future so long deprived of Germany’s youth. Democracy.\n\nWith the Hawks and Reactionaries either in internment camps or six-feet under, none are left to keep the flames of Nazism stoked within the hearts and minds of Germany’s people.

Rather than take his chances on the front lines, Kiesinger joined the Foreign Ministry under Joachim Ribbentrop, where he worked as the liaison with the Propaganda Ministry and formed a long working relationship with Joseph Goebbels. Some of Goebbels best broadcasts, some of his longest, most hate-ridden rants, were in fact Kurt's words screamed from his mouth. However, after Ribbentrop disgraced himself and Goebbels was assassinated in Moskowien, Kiesinger found himself without a patron. He discovered a new master in Albert Speer.\n\nAlthough he served Speer with fervor for many years, Kiesinger always knew that the wind could change at any moment. For a time, that meant building a relationship with Schmidt and his wretched liberals. For a time, that meant hedging his bets, making deals in smoke filled rooms with figures that saw Speer as too soft. But now, with the disaster in the East, the wind has finally changed. There are no more cards to draw. He must play the hand he's been dealt, or be thrown into the trashbin of history like the rest of the Gang of Four.

That perception has come to an end with the disaster in Eastern Europe.\n\nSpeidel served with distinction during the Second World War, most notably as Rommel's Chief of Staff. He ended the SS coup almost single handedly, and later undercut Schörner's first attempt at seizing the Wehrmacht for his own misbegotten gain. However, this tapestry of honor was not enough to save the Reich from itself. Germany is bleeding, struck through with bullet holes, and only Führer Speidel can save it.\n\nField Marshal Speidel has abandoned his post, laying down the title of Field Marshal and taking up the yoke of dictator. His intention is simple: purge Germany of Nazism, the ideology that brought it to ruin, maintain the Empire at any cost, and fight back against those who would see Germany castrated. Although the tattered remains of the NSDAP oppose him, the former Marshal has the backing of the majority of the Wehrmacht, and even a portion of the exhausted, bloodied public stand at his side. While noble, Speidel is a small island in a swirling sea, and every day the tide comes ever higher."

There is no greater threat right now than the Russian Bear kicking down our door, and the threat of losing everything we have strived for is at stake. By allowing a few wheels to be greased, every need, from the spoons to feed our soldiers to the most technically complicated weapons systems, our military will be at full strength in no time."

We shall organize these recruits according to their loyalty to the Reich, their loyalty to the cause of National Socialism, their willingness to fight, and of course their overall health. As we did with sorting our veterans, our collaborators will either be given modern equipment or leftover equipment.\n\nThe Slavic Hordes shall have to grind through their own first with massive conscripts serving to patch up our lines and keep the horde from pushing onwards. The hordes shall then have to face the reality that not all wish to return back into barbarism as they face off against divisions of loyal Slavs we deem to be honorary Aryans.

Threats of foreclosure will ensure that they will never be able to give "No" as an answer to our demands.

In one last grasp for victory we will launch a theater wide offensive to break the Bear's legions and its spirit.\n\nThe German people must fight all hours of the day, as the Führer orders, and give everything for victory. We shall use our propaganda machine to make our people desire total war. If necessary, we shall spin the necessary measures we have taken in the East as war crimes conducted by the Slavic hordes.

To keep them supplied for further operations against Russian forces, we must allow these forces to be well-equipped to take on even the strongest of units of the Russian military.\n\nWe can dispatch a few advisors and weapons via an airdrop, and from there we can help to establish a partisan network within Moskowien itself.

Since the war has demanded our most loyal citizens to the front, we must revert to what methods led us to ultimate victory in the first war: slavery.\n\nWe will make the legal precessions and accommodations necessary for our most diligent companies to employ the "undesirables" once more to increase our factories' collective output. There will be liquidations of some villages in the Ostfront, of course, but it would be foolish to let the hands of potential workers fall into that of our Asiatic nemesis.

We shall reinforce these notices by having special brigades in charge going door to door and house to house to round up as many as they can. Once these rats are found, we shall dispose of them as we usually do: display their mangled corpses on every newspaper and on every lamp post to serve as examples to all who would resist the Reich.

 POLITICS_ALBERT_SCHNEZ_DESC:0 "Many say fortune favors the bold, but in Albert's case, it favored the patient.\n\nAlbert Schnez lived and served from the days of the Weimar Republic and into the Reich. From his beginnings in the Reichsheer to his eventual prominence in the Third Reich's Heer, he climbed the ladder by battling the communists, first as a young man fighting in the eastern triumph and later as a full-fledged general. Having made a name for himself through experience and accolades, he was more than ready to retire, content with his self-made career. That was until the Russians returned for their reconquest of the east.\n\nSchnez was more than willing to take his post once more and prove his worth as a commander, expecting another victory. But as the Germans suffered a retreat and the Russians celebrated their success, Schnez reconsidered his options in the following turmoil. Perhaps he could lie low in acceptance and integrate himself into the new government, if it were not for the fatherland shattering once more into civil war when he incidentally was stationed in Bohemia.\n\nThere, Schnez and his cohort would act purely on defending his little fiefdom, a place he declared to be without conflict. It would only be a matter of time before Germany found itself new masters after the fighting died down, but Schnez would not partake in any of it, only deciding to wait, see, and protect his land."

 GER_Reconstruction_of_Germany_desc:0 "Our flag may fly proudly over every city in Germany, but the ruins and scars remain. It's time to rebuild; house by house, building by building, road by road. It will take a long time, but it is necessary if we are to see our people prosper under our vision of Germany.\n\nThe cost will be high, and it may take years. Yet, Germany has always come out stronger. We recovered from the Napoleonic wars. We recovered from the Treaty of Versailles. We shall recover from this war."

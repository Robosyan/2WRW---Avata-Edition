 HOL_fractured_national_identity_desc:0 "For nearly half a century the people of Holland have toiled under the Greater Germanic thumb. Decades of National Socialist rule over our institutions and culture has given birth to an entire generation removed from the idea of a free Netherlands, indoctrinating much of our youth into blind obedience to the Reich. It will take many, many years until a truly Dutch identity may rise again."
 
 HOL_without_a_master:0 "Without A Master"
 HOL_without_a_master_desc:0 "For decades our government has blindly followed the whims of our Germanic masters, removing any kind of political autonomy or free-will in favor of complete obedience towards the National Socialist world order. With the fall of the Reich and subsequent resurgence of an independent Russia onto the global stage, we are left without a master. Creating a chaotic power vacuum in its wake."

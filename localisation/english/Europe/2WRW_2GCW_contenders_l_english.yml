 POLITICS_SRH_Rudi_Dutschke_DESC:0 "For his entire life, Rudi Dutshcke has been a revolutionary. First for his faith in God, and now for his faith in the people.\n\nThe son of a Brandenburg postal worker, Dutschke became disillusioned with the teachings of the establishment from an early age, consuming Marxist literature and attending secret evangelical meetings as early on as high school. It was the combination of these radical actions that led him to the world of anti-fascist dissidence. Still a boy at 16, Dutschke was forced to flee his home and family after his protests against the West Russian War landed him in trouble with the Gestapo.\n\nAlthough taking refuge in the radical underground was originally a necessity, for the boy preacher, it quickly became an opportunity. Speaking of a doctrine that rejected both the hopeless authoritarianism of the USSR and the naive collaboration of the Weimar republic, Dutschke quickly rose to be one of Hanover's most prominent socialist agitators. But speeches and pamphlets could never be enough. And as the violence of the Bormann regime accelerated, the calls for violent struggle did too.\n\nNow, with the caricature Fuhrer now dead, and the Reich on its knees, Hoffman stood up to answer them. Now, with fair Deutschland in pieces, and enemies on all sides, Dutschke prepares himself for the fight of his, and his people's life. Either he will build a new Germany bathed in the light of peace and freedom.\n\nOr the forces of evil shall consume his homeland once more."

And when that very same nation had plunged its dark blade into the very heart of the Socialist torch bearer in the east, the cause of Socialism grew closer and closer to total oblivion.\n\nBut a daring few persevered, Heinz Hoffman among them.\n\nSpending the majority of his life fighting for the Socialist cause, the revolutionary wandered across Europe, serving under the flags of socialist nations from the Spanish Civil War to Operation Barbarossa. However, each would only ever be put to the torch by the German Eagle or it’s equally twisted fascist counterparts.\n\nBut with each defeat and comrade lost, Hoffman has only grown more adept and patient. When Bormann's government began to crack, and the Russian Bear awoke in the east, he made his move. Coordinating Resistance cells within the Rhineland, he hoped that he could at least dampen the Wehrmacht’s fighting capacity.\n\nBut he got far more than what he hoped for. With the relentless assault of Russian forces, the people of Germany finally snapped, crying out for a new path. Now, hundreds of thousands march under a scarlet banner, as Hoffman gambles it all on one last attempt to bring the revolution to his homeland."

It was on his shoulders that the reins of Europe broke apart; and the specter that haunted Europe was lifted at long last.\n\nNow, with Germany in ruins after another civil war, it is the duty of the government to uplift the people and lead Germany into a new world. Having won the elections and snatched victory away from the liberals and conservatives, it is Genscher’s vision that will lead Germany into the future.

When the wars ended, Walter took a long, hard look at himself and at the Germania that he had fought and killed faceless men for. What looked back at him was a nation built on tombstones.

From fighting Yugoslav partisans in Croatia to beating back the Russian hordes in the First West Russian War, Brandner stood firmly in the way of anything that would harm the Reich.\n\nHe had almost failed. The Reich had collapsed to liberal decadence, and national socialism was on the verge of defeat. Although it had come back from the brink, defeating the snakes which promised "freedom" from the one true path for Germany, our greatest faults were exposed. Nevertheless, the communists, liberals, socialists, student movements, and the debased Himmlerite pawns were all crushed into dust by Brandner's hand.\n\nAnd yet, where the NSDAP was meant to rise from the ashes stronger, another fat slug came to bear. Not willing to see the cycle repeat once more, Brandner has seceded, forming the Deutsche Arbeiterpartei.

The second invasion from the east only confirmed his fears.

Although he received unwavering support from the rank and file, it was all for naught. The Russian bear smashed the Reich on the shores of defeat, and Ferber could only find solace in the men he helped return home.\n\nAnd as the guns fell silent once more, the humiliated German government began to disintegrate.

The son of the right-hand man of Martin Bormann and the nephew of Joseph Goebbels, he has always been a proud German and loyal party member. As an adolescent, his undeniable connections granted him a leadership position in the Hitler Youth. After finishing university, this evolved into a diplomatic post in the Sphere. With this job, he would attempt to further German geopolitical goals with the Japanese and forge a life that was larger than his father's shadow.\n\nUpon his return from Asia, he stayed relevant by giving lectures at the Reich's multitude of universities. A fierce defender of Bormann's regime, he would continue his work until the Reich was impaled by the Slavic menace, forcing him to find refuge in the nation's east.\n\nIt would be the remnants of the Heer who took a fascination with his character.

In his speeches and writings, he spiritedly defended the ideals of Hitler and Bormann's vision, albeit with an unbiased and rational facade.\n\nTherefore, when the Heer marched into Southern Germany, his career — and life — were saved. With most potential civilian leaders dead and Jens' hand-crafted appearance as a safe and rational supporter of the status quo, the forces of Ernst Ferber saw him fit to serve as their puppet Führer. Now, in spite of the on-paper promotion, the Hamburg bureaucrat is left unsatisfied with his current predicament.

From the Russian heartland to the streets of London, Lemm saw his opportunities and he took them. Famously, he personally led an assault on a column of 3 T-34 tanks and led to the destruction of the Bolsheviks. Before leading the forward vanguard elements of the German Army as they invaded the United Kingdom. Soon, there was war once more on the horizon, with old enemies rearing their ugly heads once more.\n\nWith Germany’s loss in the Second West Russian War and the ceding of the hegemony Lemm and his men fought, bled, and died for, it changed something deep within him. This was not a loss, but a betrayal. Angered, Lemm once more took up arms and gathered alongside many of his older compatriots forming the Freikorp. With his army by his side he easily overthrew the floundering government in Breslau and the surrounding cities.\n\nSuddenly, Lemm had begun to feel the glory of war permeate through his old bones. With the formation of the Freikorp State, he feels a sense of duty to protect his Fatherland with all the might of the German people. There of course existed dissenters deep within the Reich, but they were to be scorched with the light of a thousand suns. Lemm will let blood flow freely from Breslau to Germania and all around the Reich. And he will take pride through every minute."
 POLITICS_SFK_Heinz_Georg_Lemm_VICTORY_DESC:0 "Through all aspects of his life, Lemm was decorated and hailed as a soldier, an officer, and a warrior. However, at this particular point in his career, it is more apt to refer to him as a survivor. Wars of unimaginable scale could not break him as the former Oberst adapted to each new tactic and front, disposing of his enemies with calculated, brutal efficiency. These traits are only partially why he now stands at the helm of a reunified Germany.\n\nIt has become quite clear that Heinz-Georg Lemm excels at another battlefield entirely. With his Freikorps, Lemm aimed to enforce the ultimate order upon Germany to restore the nation's tattered pride. The reign of lead and steel indeed may have fooled an unwitting observer into believing that Lemm was a one trick pony, single minded in action and purpose; a military man through and through. And a military man he was - though one clearly quite skilled in political maneuvering.\n\nNow the officer has triumphed over the political wings which wished to destroy what he has built, and kicked the extremists and centrists to the proverbial curb. There's no telling when his iron grip will release the nation. Lemm is retiring from military life, and will preside over his conquest to enforce proper order for the foreseeable future.

Beginning with a career in the SS that was overlooked, he clawed his way upwards, little by little. Proving himself with every victory, every drop of blood spilled both in the camps purging the unclean and excess of the Fatherland, every single promotion was a struggle.\n\nYet, after the War, he would be relegated to the rungs of the Secret Police, forever cast in the shadow of it's master, Reinhart Heydrich. Though this was not an unfavorable existence, he sought more. His time with the Police left Ernst without satisfaction that he had felt in his struggle to reach for control. When the Russian Bear came and wiped away the Reich's hegemony over Europe, Ernst took to fighting with the Freikorps, carving a center of power and influence for his own to save his beloved homeland. With the fatherland united as one, Lemm's glorified bandits and Backe's maniac's resigned to the waste bins of history, it is Erns Kalterbrunner who will step out of the darkness.\n\nNo longer shackled, it is Kalterbrunner who will forge Germany's destiny, for better or for worse."

One of the leading pioneers of the radical underground, Teufel, or the 'fun guerilla' as he is better known, became a rising star of the dissident world. Much to the chagrin of the Gestapo, his annoying antics of pelting puddings at the Reich's most esteemed politicians launched him to near universal fame in anti-fascist circles.\n\nNow, however, even the standard bearer of political humor struggles to smile.

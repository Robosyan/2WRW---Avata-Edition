 POLITICS_Ferenc_Szalasi_70s_DESC:0 "Like so many great statesmen of the 20th century, Ferenc Szálasi's life was forged in the fires of the Great War. Fighting on the side of the Austro-Hungarians, he saw first hand the weakness of a state beleaguered by too many ethnicities forced to work in supposed harmony. After the war, he continued to serve his nation in its newly formed military, becoming closely aligned with Regent Miklós Horthy. He founded the Hungarian National Socialist Party, devoting his existence to the furthering of a purified Hungarian nation.\n\nArrested for his beliefs, he was forced to work from within his prison cell, never being executed by the Hungarian state in fear of a reprisal by the German Reich. Moved into house arrest, he was able to continue his ideological work, spreading his message to his followers and marshaling forces for an eventual seizure of power.\n\nHis moment came with the Second West Russian War. Bringing together his forces of the "Arrow Cross", he has begun his crusade through Hungary to bring about his vision of a strong, pure, and powerful Hungarian state. With enemies all around him, he will not bend or break; he has the iron will of a true son of Hungary, and none will stand in his way."
 POLITICS_ANDOR_JAROSS_70s_DESC:0 "Life is a struggle, a fact every Hungarian knows all too well. Andor Jaross, as he embodies the Hungarian nation, embodies this adage.\n\nSeeing his birthplace of Komárom fall under Czechoslovak occupation at the whims of semitic capitalists, Jaross' early political agitation earned him many favors amongst the Hungarian right. In time, his power and fortunes grew in. Indeed, with fascism triumphant in Europe, the army triumphant in Transylvania, and Imrédy triumphant in Budapest, it seemed that Jaross' political destiny was almost complete. Yet, as seems inevitable to history, the nation's enemies bide their time and wait for their moment to strike once more.\n\nIf only the feeble Regent hadn't tried to bite the one hand that fed him. If only Szálasi, the rabid fool, hadn't weaseled his way into gaining Germania's favor. If only someone had paid attention to the regrouping Slavic menace in the east. If only. But now is not the time to lament on what could have been; now is the time to stand up and fight! The Bolshevik rats will be exterminated, the liberal traitors will be vanquished, and the spineless dogs in the Arrow Cross will be made to fall in line. It doesn't matter how long it takes. It doesn't matter how many have to die. It doesn't matter if every village has to be razed to the ground and rebuilt anew.\n\nLife is a struggle, and struggle Andor Jaross will."

 HUN_From_the_Shadows:0 "From the Shadows"
 HUN_From_the_Shadows_desc:0 "On paper, our cause is the defense of National Socialism in the Danube, and the destruction of the treacherous Judeo-Bolsheviks as well as the so called “Landowners Party”, a group filled to the brim with traitors and subversive elements.\n\nIn reality, we are nothing more than a puppet of the remaining Megacorporations and German elites still in the country. With their remaining influence and wealth, they pull at the puppet strings of government, seaking to only gain what little power there is to be had in the lands of Hungary."
 HUD_The_Landowners_Party:0 "The Landowners' Party"
 HUD_The_Landowners_Party_desc:0 "The party has its roots in the countryside. Our leaders have ties to powerful landowners dissatisfied with the Hungarian fascist regime alongside connections to farmers organizations from across the country populated by disgruntled farmers too long ignored by the fascists.\n\nThis alliance of interests has borne fruit, and now that we have the power, we shall free Hungary from fascist and communist influence, throw off our chains, and liberate all our people for a prosperous future."
 HUS_The_Hungarian_Red_Army:0 "The Hungarian Red Army"
 HUS_The_Hungarian_Red_Army_desc:0 "With Germany crumbling and fascist agitators hoping to destroy Hungary once again, the proletariat cries for its savior and we heed the call. Thousands flock to join our ranks, marching under the red banner as we prepare to finally free Hungary from years of oppression and fascist despotism. The so-called moderates and the fascist menace will be crushed beneath the boots of our working class liberation."

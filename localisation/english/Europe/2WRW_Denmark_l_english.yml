 DEN_German_Garrison:0 "Wehrmacht Garrison"
 POLITICS_DEN_German_Garrison_DESC:0 "Since the German conquest of Denmark, a Wehrmacht garrison has stood in the nation's capital city of Copenhagen. Being stationed in Denmark was always seen as an easy break compared to frontline service or in the faroff corners of the Reich. Officers and enlisted men alike have enjoyed the pleasant country. But their situation now is anything but pleasant.\n\nAfter the humiliating defeat in the SWRW, many other states have managed to break away from Germany, but the same can’t be said for Denmark. Control of the nation remains in the hands of the German Garrison. When orders from Germania ceased and the civil government collapsed, the Army quickly took the reins.Their leadership, and by extension Denmark, is run by a cabal of feuding officers who are wholly unprepared to rule a country.\n\nNow they sit in an extremely precarious situation.The garrison has control over large cities but their authority is non-existent in the countryside. Some rural areas openly refuse to obey their authority. The undermanned garrison, which was only equipped to deal with minor unrest, is inadequately supplied to subdue rebels. All it would take is one kick in the door for the whole rotten structure to come tumbling down. Even if they manage to weather the storm, there is no guarantee the government that emerges triumphant in Germania will be friendly to them…"
 DEN_Anker_Joergensen:0 "Anker Jørgensen"
 POLITICS_DEN_Anker_Joergensen_DESC:0 "Anker Jørgensen was born in 1922 and was rapidly orphaned as his parents were struck down by tuberculosis. Quitting school to work in a warehouse and surviving off of the mercy of his extended family, Jørgensen became involved in labor politics and by extension, the Socialdemokratiet (Social Democrats).\n\nThe war would see Jørgensen's first acts of resistance against the Germans. Refusing to be disarmed by the Germans during Operation Safari, he was ultimately captured but repatriated to Denmark, where he rapidly became involved in the country's fervent resistance movement. Fighting for a free Denmark now for almost three decades, Jørgensen has been forced to reckon with the nation's struggle against the German occupier. Yet, through gritted teeth he fought on, never abandoning his vision of a Denmark for the people.\n\nNow, with the once proud Wehrmacht reduced to ashes and Denmark's secession from the decrepit corpse of Germany's empire, Jørgensen has become Prime-Minister of a once again Free Denmark. What was once a dream may become reality, as Jørgensen now fights openly to create a realm for all of Denmark's subjects, and for his King."
 DEN_Arne_Munch_Petersen:0 "Arne Munch Petersen"
 POLITICS_DEN_Arne_Munch_Petersen_DESC:0 "Arne Munch-Petersen, born in 1904, was the son of a professor. Originally meant to be a teacher, and holding a master's degree in history, Munch-Petersen rapidly became involved in the realm of Danish communism. He was elected to the 6th Congress of the Communist International in 1928, and his involvement would only grow from there. Petersen became a courier for the Soviet Union under Bukharin, responsible for maintaining ties between the USSR, Scandinavia, Poland, and Germany. Soon he became party secretary of Denmark's communist party.\n\nWith the war coming to Denmark in 1940, Munch-Petersen was forced to take his activities underground. He maintained his responsibilities to the Comintern, keeping contact between Moscow and his contacts in Central and Northern Europe. However, when Bukharin's government fell and the Communist International splintered, Munch-Petersen chose to fight on. Even under the repressive boot of National-Socialism, Munch-Petersen never gave up on his dreams for a free Denmark under the hammer and sickle.\n\nWith Germany now defeated and its sphere thrown into disarray and confusion, Munch-Petersen is left with a chance to make his visions reality. Now, more than ever, is the time to free Denmark from the oppressive yoke of the German bootlicker, and bring her into an age where the red flag can fly proudly in Scandinavia."
 DEN_Poul_Hartling:0 "Poul Hartling"
 POLITICS_DEN_Poul_Hartling_DESC:0 "Poul Hartling was born on the 14th of August 1914 in Copenhagen where he spent all his childhood. He then studied theology to become a Priest and graduated in 1939, later heading to a teacher's seminary where he spent his time until the German Invasion in 1940. He was forced to flee to Sweden where he planned to stay until the war was over. However, the allies lost, forcing him to remain in Stockholm.\n\nThere, he attempted to continue his career in Priesthood. He became a prominent Figurehead among the Danish Exiles in Stockholm. After the relocation of the Danish political party "Venstre" to Stockholm, he became a member in 1957, quickly climbing the ranks and becoming a party leader in 1965; however, the party lacked something: hope. No one expected that Denmark would ever break free from Germania. But that hope came sooner than they could've imagined when the Germans spiraled into chaos following defeat in the East, the Reich becoming engulfed in civil war.\n\nVenstre quickly relocated back to Copenhagen after the resistance victory in the Danish Spring, where they elected Poul as their Chairman. And after Venstre's victory in the election, it seems that the hopes of many for a free and new Denmark now lay on his shoulders."
 DEN_Soeren_Kam:0 "Søren Kam"
 POLITICS_DEN_Soeren_Kam_DESC:0 "Søren Kam, born in 1921, has been nothing but an unrepentant devotee of National-Socialism and its eventual bastard offspring, the Burgundian System, since he was a child. His father a leader of the Free Corps of Denmark, an SS Unit, and his mother a member of the Danish Nationalist Socialist Workers Party, Kam was engrossed in the ideology, and it would prove no surprise that he chose to collaborate, joining the SS Division Wiking.\n\nKam would fight on the Eastern Front where he would earn honors for his actions. He would be transferred away from the front, and towards training duties for the Germanic SS, gaining leadership in the organization. After the war with Russia had ended, and Bukharin's government had collapsed, Kam would continue training new members for the SS in Germany's occupied territories. He, alongside Himmler, would be implicated in the attempted coup by the SS, and lived out the next few decades in Burgundy, participating in Himmler's "Burgundian System".\n\nWith Denmark now fractured and the iron-grip of Germany and the Wehrmacht looking to loosen, Kam has now returned to Denmark to claim and spread the tendrils of Himmler's Schutzstaffel to yet another part of the world: Denmark, his former homeland."
 DEN_Freedom_council:0 "Freedom Council"
 POLITICS_DEN_Freedom_council_DESC:0 "Despite Denmark's King and government remaining in power, if under the guidance of Germania, following Operation Weserübung, and the nation's occupation being carried out with a lighter hand than most invaded by the Nazis, over the years German Influence grew larger and larger. Denmark's economy was tied to the Reich and the threat of the Wehrmacht Garrison loomed over the country. It seemed to many that Denmark was damned to forever lick Germania's boot.\n\nThey were wrong.\n\nDespite the German Garrison's takeover of the Country, underground, plotting in basements and striking from the forests, Resistance members and Partisans banded together to finally free Denmark, and now rule in a coalition colloquially referred to as the "Freedom Council." Formed in 1943 by a group of Danish democrats and communists after the German invasion, the Council began by performing clandestine operations during the Second World War against the soldiers stationed in Denmark.\n\nAfter the war, the group went silent for a time, using the period to gain strength from wherever they could. Now, they stand at the forefront of the nation as its sole leadership. Despite the questionable legitimacy of the Council and minor infighting between the communists and democrats, it remains what is possibly the last hope for the Danish people and a truly free Denmark."

 POLITICS_GURGEN_ARUTJUNOVIC_DALIBALTAJAN_DESC: "A conscript of the Second World War and a veteran of the partisan uprisings during the Nazi occupation of the Caucausus, Gurgen Arutjunovic Dalibaltajan has spent most of his life fighting for his people's survival. Born in the Armenian-populated town of Bogdanovka, his education was cut short when the German War Machine tore through Eastern Europe, bringing death and misery in its wake. When the Reichskommissariat was established, he wasted no time in assisting the partisans by liberating as many Armenian slaves from Josias' oppression.\n\nThe monotony of partisan life continued to eat away at him until rumors from the east flooded in. Stories of a waking bear who sought to bring justice to the oppressors that laid low it long ago. He did not have to wait long as the newly formed Russian Federation swept away the last of the German menace, freeing the Caucasus once more and renewing his sense of hope.\n\nAs he walked back towards his homeland however, he was instead greeted by a border fence with a Turkish sign bolted onto it. He once more called for the liberation of his people and once more the Russians answered. Now equipped with Russian Arms and the hopes of his people, he now returns to free his beloved homeland and bring an end to Turkish oppression. He and his people have come too far to let themselves slaves again."

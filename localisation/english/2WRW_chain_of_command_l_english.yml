 RUS_chain_of_command.1.t: "Chain of Command"
 RUS_chain_of_command.1.desc: "After years of bloody toil, we have retaken the fertile lands of Rus. There is no path forward, save that which runs through Moscow.\n\nThrough years of constant warfare, our general staff has not been lax. They have learned and grown together, each contributing his unique experience to create a structure and culture that is unique to us. We possess advantages that we never had as mere warring states. We have the trust and support of our generals - and if we are lucky, the support of the soldiers as well. The coming struggle will not be won by luck. We must ruthlessly exploit these unique skills if we are to be victorious in the struggle against German imperialism. We must identify and understand these unique talents, or our greatest minds will lay fallow, and our armies the weaker for it."

 #Dmitry Yazov
 RUS_chain_of_command.2.t: "Redemption or Death"
 RUS_chain_of_command.2.desc: ""Do you know why you are here?" Dozens of half-starved malignants stood in silence. They looked to the sky, or to their feet, never at Yazov's face. Were they ashamed, or too weak to face their superior? "You are here," Yazov said, "because you have failed yourselves. Through cowardice, or criminal activity, or sloth, you have chosen to betray yourself. Worse still, you have betrayed your family, your government, and your nation." Yazov motioned to his right. "Private, please step forward."\n\nA young man, hardly sixteen, marched from the immense formation behind Yazov to the Glakoverkh's side. He saluted with machine precision. "Private Alexander Semenov at your command, Glakoverkh."\n\n"Where were you born, Private?"\n\n"I was liberated from Permhaym by the Black League and her soldiers, sir."\n\n"And why have you chosen to take the Black?"\n\n"I must avenge my mother, sir. The Aryan Brotherhood raped and murdered her. I have a duty to my family and my nation to destroy the root of such barbarism: the Germanic nation."\n\nYazov nodded. "Well said. Now, Private Semenov, if I ordered you to commit suicide, would you do so?"\n\nThe young man winced but nodded. "If my death furthers our preparations for the Great Trial, then I would follow your order."\n\n"Thank you, Private Semenov," Yazov said. He turned to face the lowlifes again. "You, there." He pointed at a particularly wretched creature, a sallow faced, bow-legged specimen marked with acne wounds. "If I ordered you to commit suicide for the sake of the Great Trial, would you follow my order?"\n\n"Are you fucking crazy?" the worm said, "No, of course I wouldn't!"\n\nWithout missing a beat, Yazov drew his revolver and shot the rebel through the eye. Brain matter sprayed through the air, coating the rats behind him in a fine mist of memories. "This is your first lesson," Yazov said. "By betraying your nation, you have sentenced yourselves to death. The only question is if your deaths will be meaningless, or serve a purpose greater than yourself.""

 #Nestor Kozin
 RUS_chain_of_command.3.t: "Inspection Day"
 RUS_chain_of_command.3.desc: ""Stop it right there, soldier! You're doing it all wrong!"\n\nGeneral Kozin stalked across the muddy courtyard, leaving the besuited group of military inspectors in his dust. Across the barracks, in another field entirely, a group of exhausted greenhorns were moments away from blowing their heads off. The general's two aides did a double take, then followed after him.\n\n"Give me that damn rifle," Kozin said. He grabbed the old AK-47 out of the private's hands, as sweat poured down the young soldier's acne-scarred face. "Look, you were about two seconds away from killing yourself." The bald general pulled back the rifle's bolt, and ejected an unfired round from the chamber. He laughed. "Ever fancy french-kissing a bullet? Me neither. Don't fuck up in my army again."\n\nKozin stood, and stepped behind them, inside the barracks these recruits called home. There were eight bunk beds, each clothed in scratchy, grey-blue sheets. The lights that swung above the linoleum floor flickered, and were universally covered in dead flies. Across the room, the flag of the Federation hung crooked and creased. And… dusty? Seven young men stood at a sloppy attention, soon joined by the Private whose life the General saved. Two had haircuts outside of regulations. Five had unshined shoes. Three had allowed grease stains onto their pants.\n\n"Jesus, what a bunch of pigs," General Kozin said. "You wouldn't have lasted five minutes in the Red Army. Can I get anything for you? Smoothie? Manicure? Maybe a nicer pillow so you can take a nap?"\n\n"No, sir!" the privates shouted back.\n\n"Fuck me, I ought to court martial your Sergeant. If the President was here he'd tear his hair out." Kozin felt the battered wood of the rifle underneath his fingertips. "Actually, I have an idea. Let's see if you've been paying attention to your instructors. If any of you can safely clean and reassemble your rifles before me, I'll give you two days leave and, let's say, five hundred out of my pocket." The privates around the room lit up. "But if I beat all of you, I'm going to work your asses until you can't remember what sleeping looks like."\n\nOne of the privates raised his hand. "But, sir-"\n\nKozin cut him off with a shout. "Start!""
 RUS_chain_of_command.3.a: ""Get ready for the ass-kicking of a lifetime.""
 
 #Nikolay Rumyantsev
 RUS_chain_of_command.4.t: "Kepi Blanc"
 RUS_chain_of_command.4.desc: ""LEGIO!" The platoon shouted out of sync. Nikolay Rumyantsev gritted his teeth, noting every error with practiced precision.\n\n"PATRIA!" The platoon held their arms straight out - in theory. In reality, the recruit's arms wavered, and too many hesitated before committing to the action.\n\n"NOSTRA!" These men had a long way to go before they'd be ready to join His Majesty's army. That was certain, certain as the rising sun.\n\nThe platoon conducted an inexpert about face, with none of the precision or care General Rumyantsev and his staff had demonstrated hours ago. "Lord! Save Russia! And bring! Her peace!"\n\n"Enough!" General Rumyantsev waved his hand, a pained expression on his face. "You're embarrassing me, all of you. I'd be better off sleeping under a bridge." He shook his head. "Gentlemen, we are going to conduct this drill until you get it right. Until you demonstrate that you possess the discipline necessary to serve our Tsar and our Motherland. Get ready for a long night."\n\nA murmur of whines and half-hearted 'yes sir's' rose up from the listless platoon. "No, no, that's not right," Rumyatsev said. "My nation's soldiers don't complain when they're told to sacrifice. Line up!"\n\nThe Russian soldiers lurched into a single file line. The General marched to the front of the line, and wordlessly extended his fist. Each of the recruits marched forward and headbutted his knuckles, leaving bruises and cuts on their foreheads. Every single one of the soldiers punished themselves, some even striking themselves harder to outdo their brothers. One even knocked out a tooth.\n\nThe drill continued until 03:00 the next day. By the end, the recruits were raw, bleeding, and exhausted. But, finally, they were ready to serve their country."

 #Pavel Batov
 RUS_chain_of_command.5.t: "Servant of Men"
 RUS_chain_of_command.5.desc: "Mischa Morozova opened the door to her home, wiping away stinging tears. "H-hello?"\n\nNone other than Marshal Pavel Batov stood on her doorstep, back straight as a steel beam. His cap was tucked beneath his right arm, and he stared straight ahead. "Mrs. Morozova. May I come in?"\n\n"O-of course. I'm sorry about the house, I haven't had time to clean since-"\n\nBatov cut her off with a raised hand. "I understand, Mrs. Morozova. I doubt I'd do any better, under the circumstances." Mischa cracked a false smile and stood aside, permitting the officer's entry. "You have a beautiful home," he said, wiping his feet on her entry mat.\n\n"It's been in my family for five generations. I suppose I'll be the last."\n\nBatov winced. "I'm sorry. Is there anything I can do for you?"\n\n"Can you bring my son back from the dead? Can you turn back time, so I can throw myself at his feet, beg him not to join your army?" Mrs. Morozova sobbed, but she refused to cover her eyes. "Alexei never did anything wrong in his life. Always defending others, always standing up to bullies. That's how he met his wife. But we lost Natalya, and now…"\n\n"I'm truly sorry. I can't imagine what I'd do if I lost my Margarita."\n\n"You do nothing. My life is over, General. It ended with my son."\n\nPavel pursed his lips, and took a deep breath. "Mrs. Morozova. When I was engaged in the campaign against the Black League, your son served in my command. The Glakoverkh sent an elite unit to hunt me down, the Operativnaya Grupa Bogatyr. I can't tell you how long we fought them, the night they found us. But your son was by my side the whole time. Bogatyr's leader, a man named Pastanogov, this fanatic, inhuman soldier, fought his way into our command post and had his hands around my throat. I thought I was going to die. But Alexei - I'm sorry, your son - shot him. He saved my life. Everything that's happened since then is because of him. Because of you, and the sacrifices you made to raise him."\n\nHe took a breath. "I can't thank you enough, Mrs. Morozova. I can't stem your grief. But, please, understand. Your son was a hero.""

 #Boris Krylov
 RUS_chain_of_command.6.t: "In My Father's Image"
 RUS_chain_of_command.6.desc: "Boris Krylov sat in his study, alone, the cloying leather of his father's armchair digging into his skin. The air stank of perfume. An old paperback, half detached from its spine, lay before him. But the words had long since melted into a literary slurry. "I don't know why I bother trying," he muttered. "Not a bit of this makes sense."\n\nIt was impossible to tell the time. It was past midnight, judging by the bags under his eyes, though the sun had not yet risen. The majestic flames in his fireplace had long since died out. It was cold, and he was hungry, but his attention lay elsewhere.\n\nA bottle of imported Scottish brandy lay upright on the table. Boris had snatched it off the shelf, even though he'd sworn not to drink after his father's death. It was only supposed to be decorative, as foolish as that was, only supposed to be a prestigious item to overawe visitors. But Boris found himself tracing his finger over the brim, marveling at the clarity of the glass, the purity of the liquid. He tilted the decanter thirty degrees to the side, then back down, and watched a bead of exotic liquor race back to the bottom.\n\nMaybe it would make him feel better.\n\nThe thought had come to mind more than once. His father drank - drank heavily - to a degree that even the Kingsguard thought he must have been suicidal. It seemed to make him a different person - not happier, but calmer, better able to juggle the brutal tasks a monarch must force himself against. Boris was no king. Never would be. Even his lofty position was too much for him. He needed to grieve, to rest, to make some sense out of just what'd happened to his family, his country, his entire way of life. Nothing made sense anymore!\n\nBoris Krylov wrapped his fingers around the bottle's neck. He imagined lifting it, putting the cool glass to his lips, tipping a fine pour straight down his aching throat. By God, he could taste the brandy, feel it burning his throat, promising sweet intoxication.\n\nIf only it would make him feel better.\n\nBoris let go of the bottle, and tipped it over the edge of his desk with a single flick. It fell to the ground with a flat thud, but didn't shatter. The King's son watched in annoyance as it began to spill expensive alcohol over his favorite rug."

 #Androniy Mishurenko
 RUS_chain_of_command.7.t: "Redemption Day"
 RUS_chain_of_command.7.desc: ""Officer Stepanov. Come in, please." The young man had grown since the last time General Mishurenko laid eyes on him. That was years ago, when the Black Army only held Kansk and Bratsk, before the Far Eastern campaign and the petty squabbling. Yet despite all their trials and tribulations, General Stepanov's son was still a wiry, trembling little snot.\n\n"Comrade Mishurenko, I-I'm not sure why I'm here," Mikhail Stepanov said.\n\n"Actually, I think you do," Mishurenko said. He began to drum his fingers on the desk. "Comrade Stepanov, would you rate yourself as a competent officer?"\n\nMikhail ran his hands through his hair. "I've always, uh, always tried to uphold my duties-"\n\n"Tried. Not succeeded." Mishurenko stood and leaned forward, towering over his desk and the young Officer. "Comrade. We are moments away from commencing the campaign to retake Moscow. We have access to some of the most brilliant soldiers from across Russia, from former members of the Revolutionary Front, to reactionaries who've changed their ways. Can you honestly tell me you deserve to lead a militia against the Reich?"\n\nStepanov found himself staring at the General's chest, unable to look him in the eye. "No."\n\n"You became an officer solely due to your father's influence."\n\n"Yes."\n\n"Not because of your qualities. Your name. Hardly in line with our ideals." Mishurenko took a breath. "And yet. Members of your unit tell me, begrudgingly, that you are quite adept at issues of logistics. You ended up saving quite a few of our boys from starving after all." The General marched from behind his desk to the young man's side, and put his hand on his shoulder. "In the coming war, we need everyone to serve where they are most capable. Not for their own sake, but for the sake of the people. Step aside. Let another take your position on the front lines, and join our quartermasters. We could use someone with a bit of humility."\n\nStepanov chuckled like a man facing the gallows. "And what will my father say?""
 RUS_chain_of_command.7.a: ""Forget about your father! It's time to step out from beneath his skirt.""
 
 #Leonid Brezhnev
 RUS_chain_of_command.8.t: "Keep an Eye Open"
 RUS_chain_of_command.8.desc: ""You know, I spent a whole year as head of the Dniprodzerzhynsk Metallurgical Technicum," General Brezhnev said. He took a drag of his cigarette. "Did you really think we wouldn't find out?"\n\n"General, please, I don't know what you're talking about!" The balding, obese head of the Ural Automotive Plant squirmed at Brezhnev's feet, smearing mud over his trousers. His wrists and ankles were tied, and his glasses were smeared with grease.\n\n"It was quite a clever scheme," Brezhnev said. "Replacing the freshly manufactured part for the trucks with older, spare modules, and reselling the newer parts on the black market. I'm sure you made your partners very rich." He took another breath of smoke. Much higher quality than the disgusting excuses he'd smoked during the Anarchy. All thanks to his friends in Arkhangelsk, of course. "I only wish I'd thought of it myself." Brezhnev threw his cigarette butt at the plant manager's head.\n\nThe bureaucrat yelped as it burned him."What are you going to do to me?" the plant manager said, sobbing.\n\nLeonid sighed. "I'm afraid I have to shoot you, my friend."\n\nThe plant manager only began to thrash harder. "Wait! I have a family, my daughter is only seven. Please!"\n\nThe General shrugged. "I don't expect you'll be able to change my mind." He removed his pistol from its holster, and checked that the chamber was clear. "Goodbye, my friend. Perhaps I'll send your daughter a Christmas card."\n\n"NO!" The plant manager held up his hands, as though that'd stop a bullet. "I-I'll cut you in on the deal! Fifty-fifty!"\n\n"Not worth my time." Brezhnev put the barrel of his pistol on the plant manager's head.\n\n"SEVENTY-THIRTY!"\n\nLeonid smiled. "It'll be ninety-ten, comrade." He stowed his pistol with a practiced movement, and picked the fat man up by the shoulder. "Come, let's clean you up.""

 #Ivan Konev
 RUS_chain_of_command.9.t: "Maskirovka"
 RUS_chain_of_command.9.desc: "Private Jürgen Schulz squinted, and cupped his calloused hands over his eyes. "I think I see something, sir."\n\nSergeant Schwarz slapped him on the back of the head. "Something? What, a whale? A tobacco plantation? A fucking donkey dancing the samba? Be specific before I ship you back to Saxony."\n\nPrivate Schulz rubbed the back of his head, wincing, before he turned back to the east. "Looks like a broken down car, sir. Fresh. There's a sign in the window that says 'Help Needed'."\n\nThe Sergeant grunted. "Odd. There shouldn't be any settler movements on this portion of the border. Schulz, Voigt, Wolff, you're with me." The squad of four soldiers gripped their rifles and set off into the distance, scanning the horizon as they walked. Each of them expected an ambush, though from where they couldn't be sure. They checked the ground as they walked, prepared through bitter experience for bear traps or pits. Sergeant Schwarz watched for the glint of a sniper rifle.\n\nThe four soldiers made their way to the car ten minutes later, without issue. There was no one there. The Sergeant knelt in the dirt, rifle to his shoulder, and motioned to the vehicle with two fingers. "Schulz, you're up."\n\nPrivate Schulz approached the abandoned truck on trembling knees. It was a faded green, paint scraped and rusting in patches, with a broken windshield and a slashed tire. A hand written plea sat in the rear window, titled to one side.\n\nJürgen eased open the driver-side door. No one was inside. But there was a note, folded in half, lying on the driver's seat.  Jürgen picked it up, unfolded it, and read. "Dear fascists, welcome to Russia," he said. "Enjoy your visit. Love, Marshal Konev."\n\nThen, the bomb hidden in the car's engine block exploded, and the four soldiers knew no more."

 #Mikhail Markheev
 RUS_chain_of_command.10.t: "Tread Carefully"
 RUS_chain_of_command.10.desc: ""Respectfully, Comrades, this tank design is no good." General Markheev sat before a freshly drawn blueprint depicting an iteration of the T-52. The bulky Buryat's eyes flitted across the page, stopping every few seconds to rest upon another deficiency, noting each failure with military precision.\n\n"We know you mean no disrespect, Comrade Markheev," Alexsandr Ivanovich, the lead designer, said. "But, respectfully, you are not an engineer."\n\n"Maybe not. But I performed hundreds of hours of maintenance on my T-52 when I fought in Tver," Markheev said. A broad smile erupted on his face."Of course, I'm always open to corrections from my comrades."\n\n"As are we," Ivanovich hissed. "What are your concerns, General?"\n\n"The treads. In Tver, the Germans would target our treads with mines to try and immobilize us. You've invented an entirely new category of tread to fit this new width. But more than anything we need cheap, plentiful spares to keep moving. Otherwise, the tank falls behind. By the time it gets back to the front, the war could already be over!" Mikhail snapped his fingers. "Another thing. Why haven't we included standardized radio transmitters? There are plenty of R-113s left over from the Great Patriotic War."\n\n"We intended that the troops would communicate with hand radios."\n\n"No good! No good at all!" Markheev shook his head. "You're going to give the entire Soviet armored corps concussions. One second, motoring down the old highway, on the lookout for Panzers. The next, you hit a bump in the road, and WHAM! Your fucking radio challenges you to a boxing match. No, no, we need integrated radio in the next model."\n\n"Do we?" Ivanovich began to drum his fingers on the table. "We were ordered to make a cheaper tank, for the purposes of mass production."\n\nMarkheev smiled. "And I was ordered to retake Moscow, comrade." He clapped the engineer on the shoulder."

 #Dmitry Ustinov
 RUS_chain_of_command.11.t: "No Step Back"
 RUS_chain_of_command.11.desc: "The knotted whip sang through the air and crashed into the teenager's back. His skin, already bruised and battered, finally broke, and a thick ooze of blood trickled down his spine. Dmitry Ustinov struck him again, then again, then again, his ferocity only increasing with each blow. The rest of the training camp looked on as their former comrade screamed for mercy.\n\nEventually, the former soldier fell to his knees, though the rope that bound his hands to the wooden post before him kept him from fully collapsing. Ustinov spat on him, and turned to the dozens of privates watching him. "What am I to say in the face of the most horrible crime a soldier can commit?" Ustinov said. "Desertion is not just a betrayal of your duty. It is not just the breaking of your word. It is a knife in the back to every! Soldier! In our army!"\n\nUstinov wiped a thick sheen of sweat off his forehead. "An army functions on trust, and loyalty. When you, comrades, go into battle, you must know that your fellow soldiers will fight by your side, that they will fight for their nation and their unit. That, when the Germans come to kill you, they will give their lives to defend yours. This man-" Ustinov pointed to the weeping prisoner, "- betrayed that trust. He told each and every one of you that his life matters more than yours. He may as well have strangled you himself. Are you going to take that lying down?"\n\nFor a brief moment, the regiment teetered in concern. In the next, a burly man at the back of the audience uncrossed his arms. "Fuck no!"\n\nUstinov nodded. "Good." He stepped to the closest soldier and handed him the whip. "Each of you are to strike him once. If I see any of you give him any less than your strongest blow, you're joining him.""

 #Genrikh Lyushkov
 RUS_chain_of_command.12.t: "The Case of the Oriental Anti-Soviet Military Organization"
 RUS_chain_of_command.12.desc: "General Genrikh Lyushkov brushed his finger over the scalpel's edge. "Gurgen, Gurgen, Gurgen," he drawled, chuckling. "I don't understand your thinking. Why resist? You're only giving me an excuse to enjoy myself."\n\nGurgen Aseryants, former general, hung from the ceiling, naked. Fetters chained to his wrists kept his arms wrenched behind his back, and he stood tip-toe on bruised feet. Floodlights blazed in his bloodshot eyes. Deep purple bruises and weeping cuts marred his recently shaven head, and a rotten brown patch on his side marked the location of two broken ribs.\n\n"We know you're working with the Japanese," Lyushkov said. He threw a pile of documents at Aseryants' feet. "Or do you intend to plead that these pictures of you in Manchuria are a case of mistaken identity?"\n\nGurgen coughed up a thimbleful of blood, and raised his battered head. "I was ordered…" he wheezed, "ordered to infiltrate the Union of Reservists. Yagoda knows! Ask Yagoda-"\n\n"Genrikh Yagoda has no knowledge of this alleged infiltration," Lyushkov said. "There are no records suggesting you were given such an assignment."\n\nAseryants hung his head again. "You destroyed the records."\n\n"I have done no such thing. Furthermore, we have signed affidavits from dozens of individuals claiming that you hold Sablinist and revisionist tendencies, that you have questioned the leadership of the Union, that you have engaged in factionalism and attempts to divide the Party. Do you deny these claims?"\n\nThe prisoner moaned. "Please, I am dedicated to the Motherland, and the Union. Have mercy on me, I beg you!"\n\nLyushkov slapped him on the back of the head. "So you admit it! You admit you require mercy! To think, I once called you a comrade. The people's revolution does not require or benefit from mercy, and we will not apologize for the terror!" Lyushkov grabbed Aseryants by the chin and thrust his head upwards. He looked the beleaguered wretch in the eyes, the scalpel in his other hand. "Now, I've taken the liberty of preparing your written confession. You may sign it, or we may continue.""

 #Alexander Pavlov
 RUS_chain_of_command.13.t: "Diggy Diggy Hole"
 RUS_chain_of_command.13.desc: "General Alexander Pavlov watched over the dirt-soaked conscripts of the 51st infantry brigade. Largely composed of young men from Tyumen, High Command considered them to be less than reliable due to the political taint of the previous regime. Pavlov meant to set them right.\n\nTogether, they rehearsed the most basic of modern military actions, digging a trench. It was a basic function of this century - breaking your body for a meager yet necessary defense, struggling with the man beside you to destroy a bit of your homeland for the sake of liberating its totality. So, with beads of sweat falling off their foreheads, each soldier carried out preparations for their segment of the line.\n\nBut they were fucking it up. Pavlov walked onto one of the many great mounds of dirt, his body casting a long shadow in the midday sun. He spoke like a teacher whose student couldn't add two and two. "Soldiers of Russia, I must ask you all a dreadful question. Where is the direction of occupied Moscow?"\n\nThe men of the brigade shared glances, before settling on the bookish man that made the rightmost portion of the trench. Feeling a great many eyes staring at him, he covered his eyes, glanced at the sun, then pointed to the West. "That way, sir!" His voice had only recently discovered how to project itself.\n\nPavlov nodded. "Then I must ask, why throw dirt in every direction? If you know where the enemy is, the key is putting cover between you and them. Or are you trying to cover your rear?"\n\nThe men stood, some with their hands thrust in their pockets, others rocking back and forth on the balls of their feet. Pavlov held back an unprofessional sigh. "Gentlemen, I assure you, our government does not maintain any sort of commissar system. We are not watching you for ideological purity. In my army, there is only one question to answer. Do you hate the Nazis? Do you hate them enough to kill them? As long as the answer is yes, I am on your side. Now, correct this error before I send your rations on to the pigs!""

 #Dmitry Volkogonov
 RUS_chain_of_command.14.t: "Our Destiny"
 RUS_chain_of_command.14.desc: ""We'll continue this tomorrow, General. Good night."\n\n"Understood, good night, Minister."\n\nIt was nearing midnight and the last meeting of the day had just ended. Volkogonov retired to his study, looking over the plans drawn for the coming war. He almost couldn't believe it. Just yesterday, the Russian 'Empire' was a destitute principality in the Far East, fighting wars of attrition on all fronts, hardly surviving. Now the Empire had come so far. Bolt action rifles became modern assault weapons, cavalry became armored vehicles and an oppressive military junta made up of bitter geriatrics was now a modern constitutional monarchy with a benevolent Emperor they'd all but stolen from his homeland.\n\nThe last decade had changed everything, and everyone. Volkogonov was especially impressed with how far His Majesty had come. He was beloved by his people. A foreign born distant relative of the last Romanov Emperor, but a Romanov still. And as a Romanov, Volkogonov thought, it was his destiny to lead Russia out of the darkness. As Volkogonov pondered on the idea of destiny something clicked, a realization that almost made him leap from his chair. It's not just Mikhail's destiny that is being fulfilled, but the White Army's. The wars in the Far East, the march to Archangelsk, and now the war against Germany. The Empire has come so far because God had decreed it so. Whether it be the Bolsheviks of Irkutsk and Buryatia, the Nazis of Zeya and Berlin or even the militarists within Chita itself, it was the White Army's destiny to liberate the Russian people from tyranny and restore God's kingdom in Russia.\n\nVolkogonov opened his journal and started writing. "This is why this war is so important. It will not only be the biggest war in Russian history, it will be the war that will decide the fate of all Russia. This war of liberation will either confirm or deny the destiny of the White Army.""

He stood amidst the barracks in Vologda, dozens of young, fertile Aryans looking on in awe. It was dark, and cramped, and the barracks stank of sweat. "Brothers, when our Fyurer speaks of a race war, he means it literally. This is not simply a war of the battlefield, but a battle of genetics and spirit. A war of nations."\n\n"When we win the war on the battlefield, Moshkowien will pass into Aryan hands for the first time in thirty years. You know what's in Moshkowien? Land. Green fields, fit for plowing and raising good, Aryan children. And you know what you need to make good Aryan children?"\n\nA disheveled young man shouted from the back of the room. "Women!"\n\n"That's right, women! Plenty of whores out there, desperate, alone. No one to protect them. Why, you can't even walk five inches past the border guards without stumbling on maidens with dead fathers. Dead brothers, dead husbands - no one to protect them." He licked his lips. "No one to miss them."\n\nA balding Sergeant at Schvarzenbakh's left hand chuckled. "German women?"\n\n"Settlers, aye, settler women with no way back to Germania. Russian skanks, though I think you've grown tired of them!" Every brute in the room cheered, congratulating each other for their bravado. "Azeri and Tatars too, if you want something exotic. Finns, Ukrainians, Georgians. Any flavor of bitch you could want will be yours."\n\nHe clapped his hands. "And so, my brothers, when we speak of the war, don't think of the glory of battle. Think of the glory of populating Moshkowien with your breed; think of the war in your loins! Fulfill your duties, kill the untermenschen, and a lifetime of pleasure will be yours!""

 RUS_chain_of_command.16.desc: "Lieutenant Revolda Balabanova rounded the corner, her squad of five men right behind her. The street was dirty, covered in trash and broken glass that crunched underfoot. She smiled. Damn, it was nice to have new boots. She'd have to remember to send Comrade Quartermaster Preobrazhensky a bottle of vodka.\n\nBalabanova brought her rifle's sights to her eyes and scanned the street. "Any bogies?"\n\n"None, sir," the man behind her said. "Affirmative, got nothing," another replied.\n\n"Excellent. Let's get to the objective sharpish, and we'll be home by supper." Revolda lowered her rifle, scouring the endless rooftops and alleys for shooters. Across the street, a rusty sign held up by a single chain snapped, and fell to the ground. She flinched, but continued her journey down the street. One, two, three heartbeats passed, and no enemy appeared. Surely they didn't intend to just allow her squad to waltz into-\n\nRevolda took her last step forward and felt a millimeter-thin trip wire snap. Only as her eyes widened in shock could she see the shine of the metal wire, wound between a light pole and a nearby shop door. A bomb hidden inside a rusty car exploded, splattering her and the two men behind her with scarlet paint. A bit flew into her mouth - a revolting brew, chalky and sour like cheap cough medicine. A pair of shooters exploded out of a trashcan three alleys behind her, and lit up the remaining members of her squad with paintballs that landed like hornet's stings.\n\nAs Revolda stood in the middle of the false street, dripping paint and cursing, the loudspeakers hidden throughout the arena crackled to life. "Comrade Lieutenant Balabanova, I'm afraid you've failed this exercise," General Oplesnin said. "Can you tell me what your error was?"\n\n"Sir, failed to scan for traps, sir!"\n\n"Precisely, Comrade. When we enter Moscow, it is overwhelmingly likely that the Germans will attempt to engage us in urban warfare. You know, when I led the KKP militia, I killed thirteen Eurasianists, just like this." He cleared his throat. "Tripwires have to be tied to something stationary. Next time, take the street, not the sidewalk.""

Sergeant Alexsandr Petrov knocked on the splintered pine wood of the farmhouse, three of his men covering his back. No one answered. He took the butt of his rifle and pounded it against the doorframe. "Official business, open up!"\n\nSomeone shifted inside. "I paid my taxes! Now fuck off!"\n\n"This is the goddamn army, bitch!" Petrov screamed. "If you don't open this door, I'll blast it down."\n\n"Alright, alright," the voice called. "One second." A heartbeat passed before an old man in a thin nightgown scraped open the flimsy door. His face was wrinkled, and his bald head was haloed with a few scraps of porcelain hair. He was thin, and his knees wobbled just from the effort of standing. "What do you want?" he spat.\n\n"I think you already know, Mister Sokovlov," Petrov said. He placed his finger on the trigger of his rifle. "Your family's business with General Meandrov isn't concluded. He sent us here to collect."\n\nThe old man sighed in disgust, and shook his head. "I already told you, I paid my taxes. Isn't one robbery enough?"\n\n"I'm talking about your son's gambling debt," Petrov said. "Surely you know that he owes the General money. Or did you disown him?"\n\nThe wind picked up, causing the end of the nightgown to flutter in its frigid grasp. Sokovlov grabbed the fabric and forced it down to his knees. "I don't talk to my son," he stammered in trembling nervousness. "I wouldn't know about any gambling debts. Frankly, I'm surprised he's still alive."\n\n"About that…" Petrov motioned to one of his subordinates. He pulled several polaroids out of his pocket and thrust them in front of Sokovlov's face. On them was his son, tied and bloody with blotches of grey on white, the latest edition of the Zlatoust Times held in his crushed hands. "Your son is in very serious trouble, Mister Sokovlov," Petrov said.\n\nThe old man's face blanched. "H-how much do you want?" he whispered."

 RUS_chain_of_command.18.desc: "The 238th Tatar Rifle Brigade was collectively freezing to death in the bitter cold of Pletesk. They had been sent up from their homes to train in the Arctic mountains of Russia. They did not run, they did not jump, or do endless exercises. They sat in a trench and waited, still as the dead.\n\nThe silence broke with a firm and powerful shout. "Men! You are being tested right now more than any drill, more than any physical training!" boomed Marshal Sergey Akhromeyev. "Yes comrades! You are being pushed harder. When I did my utmost to defend Leningrad, I held one street for two months with almost no supplies. I sat there, in a building, for sixty days and nights, still as a rock."\n\nThe tiniest shuffling was heard throughout the trench; the wind carried the chatter of teeth. Akhromeyev picked up a gun and quickly shot two bullets into the air.\n\nHe turned to the two who made the sound, despite being hidden deep in a snowy trench,  and pointed at them. "You two have just been killed by Germans. Your position has been shelled, your comrades have died. That is the cost of failure! Again!"\n\nIf the 238th felt upset, or mad, they did not show it. A small number of whispers flew in the snow, but nothing else. Then, silence passed once more. Utter silence, as the exercise began again.\n\n"It is not so hard to give oneself into the charge, it is easy to run into death - and you will do so! But you'll find, comrades, that it is much harder to wait silently, in fear, agonizing fear, for the right moment to strike. But your comrades, your families, your people, require it. We start counting again."\n\nSilence reigned for a moment, and then, in a dastardly ploy, Akhromeyev shouted once more: "Who is with me, comrades!"\n\nNone responded, for there was something more important than a shout. Between blasts of cold, the Marshal, clothes painted white with snow, smiled."

 RUS_chain_of_command.19.desc: "Columns marched through Vyatka in beautiful form, each in their place, moving in lockstep. This was the force, the raw energy of National Socialism and of the Slavic people's power. General Konstantin Ageev looked upon his meticulous organizational work and smiled. Yes, this was his talent, to put everything in its place.\n\nYet, as they marched, with families and Blackshirts waving swastikas and other paraphernalia, Ageev could not help but look upon the ragged shape of his men. The bow-legged recruits, the thin arms, the pouches on chests where there should be planes, no, something was wrong. Ageev was not the man for this job. He was never supposed to be. He was meant to command some rear echelon's force, a supporter in the broad struggle for God, Nation, and Labor. One who arranges things, like a beautiful parade, and not for combat.\n\nPerched upon a balcony overlooking the streaming columns, deafened by the sounds of marching trumpets and drum batteries, everything began to fade into static noise for the general. He considered the man who would be in front of them, were he not shot. But Lev Okhotin was killed for treason, and for his embezzlement of massive funds for bribery over years, so they said. Yet - yet! Something in Ageev's mind felt only dread when he looked upon the momentous task given by his Vozhd. More dangerously, that piece of Ageev's mind also felt doubt.\n\nThe columns stopped and turned, not like a machine, but like a rusty screw being forced out. The generals cringed as they imagined the Vozhd examining this shameful scene. Finally, their mouths opened.\n\n"For God, Nation, and Labor! For the Vozhd! For Russia!" The National Army's shouts traveled as rain, falling to and fro around the square, and then falling aside. The crowd weakly echoed it back.\n\nMaybe it could be overcome, maybe it would amount to nothing. But everyone on that platform felt that a terrible mistake was made in the halls of Zeya so long ago."

His brothers in the officer reserve corp dashed through stinking mud in straight lines, bound by wooden boards and sadistic wire on both sides. As they approached a low obstacle, they fell into a crawl, catapulting themselves with their arms and legs, scrambling to rise to continue the course.\n\nBehind them, a shot rang through the forest. Nobody stopped.\n\nIn the next few seconds, three more shots echoed in the forest. The next obstacle was a large wooden board they had to vault over. One crashed through - shot! One stumbled on the fall - shot! The pattern continued: run, shots, climb, shots, run, shots, crawl, shots, until they finished and turned around.\n\nHalf the comrades in his platoon lay behind them, strewn about the course, their life blood mingling with brackish filth. One had his legs tangled in wire, the other slumped on a wooden board Miron had vaulted over. Many lay on their stomachs, shot in the back by a pursuer they never saw.\n\nThe course commander was overshadowed by a bald man in a heavy, black coat. "Salute for Marshal Okho-"\n\nOkhotin cut the officer off with a raised arm. "That isn't important." He turned to the candidates. "You have survived one challenge. Many more await you if we are to rebuild Russia and cleanse the world from Judeo-Bolshevik and Kosher-Fascist rot. If I order you to do this again, who will do so?\n\nAt once, a few raised their hands. Miron and a few others followed.

 RUS_chain_of_command.21.desc: ""Sir, are you here for the sermon?" A man dressed in the cleanest clothes in wind-bitten Arkhangelsk approached Pavel Sudoplatov as he made his way from the docks. Pavel had been inspecting the construction of coastal defenses, in case of a German naval attack. He still wasn't sure if they'd hold against a combined Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine offensive, but-\n\n"Is there something wrong, sir?" The man looked with concern at the General.\n\n"I…" Sudoplatov instinctually prepared to say no. He was not here to attend any silly sermon or speech given by a self-proclaimed messenger of God. But he did need a break from dealing with incompetent engineers… "Could you point me in the right direction?"\n\n"Of course." He pointed down the street. "Only a few blocks away from the docks."\n\nPavel nodded, and departed without another word. The church down the street had been recently renovated. Every building around it was worn to poverty by the arctic weather; but the temple was pristine, refined, its steeple pointing proud into the sky. Its priest had led his flock outside to the front steps and spoke before an ever growing crowd. Pavel slipped into the multitude, and listened.\n\n"Soon, our men will go marching westward to free our brethren from bondage under the pagans and devil worshippers in Germany." The priest spoke with calm passion, his eyes locked on the horizon. "And, like Moses, we shall march back to the heartland of Mother Russia and free our people. But there will be no second Exodus, for our promised land lies to the west as well, in Moscow. Just as King Herod built the Second Temple in Jerusalem, so shall we re-sanctify Saint Basil's Cathedral as a second temple to our Lord. Amen."\n\nAs the crowd replied in amens and the service turned towards hymnal Psalms, the priest's words rolled around in Pavel's head. He was reminded of the forgiveness Alexander showed him after his betrayal. He looked over the crowd, who hung onto every word the priest uttered. Perhaps he had been wrong. Faith had given the people of Russia hope, and that may have been its greatest gift of all.""

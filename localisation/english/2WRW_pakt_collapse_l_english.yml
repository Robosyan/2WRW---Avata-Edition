 pakt_collapse.1.desc: "Although unrest has always been an issue for the Master of Europe, with the collapse of frontlines in the nascent war, violent protesting has reached heights unseen since the death of Hitler. Be it Bonn or Breslau, liberals or anarchists, revolutionary movements have erupted in staggering numbers, with protestors even routing riot police in some cities.\n\nThe Reich has naturally played down the riots as "rowdy youths", while accusing the United States as the arbiter of their "Zionist violence". Despite Germania's calmness, however, with more and more men desperately needed at home being sent to the frontlines, one must wonder how the German Reich expects to handle this worsening crisis."

Our intelligence estimates that over eighty percent of their forces have been withdrawn to fight in the war in Europe. The rest are stricken by plague, starving, and lack the equipment to even feign resistance. They will surely cower and dissolve as soon as the great men of the Imperial Japanese Navy face them.\n\nUnder my orders, the Southwest Area Fleet has already been adequately supplied for the journey.

According to reports, a series of amphibious invasions captured the colony with little effort, an unsurprising fact given the resident garrison's critical lack of supplies; most of its troops having been withdrawn to fight in Europe. Although the new naval administration has promised to eventually establish an 'independent Malagasay republic', reports of native partisans and Zaibatsu mining operations have cast doubt on these claims.\n\nThe Reich has condemned the seizure, stating it will reclaim its 'Lebensraum' as soon as it is able.

According to Japanese reports, a series of amphibious landings seized the two German territories with little effort, an unsurprising fact given the resident garrison's critical lack of supplies; most of their troops having been withdrawn to fight in Europe.\n\nGerman diplomats have condemned the seizure, promising to reclaim their "rightful territory" as soon as they are able.

The price of bread, milk, and other basic necessities has more than tripled over the last week, and prices are predicted to continue to rise.\n\nAll throughout the country, riots and protests have swelled with masses of starving citizens, looting anything of nutritional value they can find.

These analysts were proven wrong today, as Knut Møyen, leader of the antifascist revolutionary group known as "Milorg", announced from the steps of the Stortinget that the Reich-aligned Norwegian government has been overthrown in a highly organized, but almost entirely bloodless coup.\n\nDespite the Reich's denouncement of his nascent regime, and scattered anti-Milorg forces still under siege, Møyen has already begun making overtures to the OFN and planning elections, promising his people that "the light of liberty will shine on Norway again." Only time will tell, however, if such a promise can ever be fulfilled."

However, we could have never expected that out of the so-called 'Unity Pact', an applicant to our Organization of Free Nations would emerge.\n\nRecently, the underground pro-democracy resistance group 'Milorg' successfully usurped power in Norway. Although the free nations of the world were unable to protect the Nordic nation in its hour of need over thirty years ago, they nonetheless have not forgotten the support the OFN has provided them since.\n\nThe new government has already submitted an in-depth roadmap towards the holding of free and fair elections in one years time. They have also established a diplomatic corps that is ready to begin dialogue with us. Moreover, their position in Europe holds vital strategic value in our fight against global tyranny, and should the Reich manage to retain even a semblance of the sphere of influence they once held, they will ensnare Norway in its grip again, most likely with extreme force.\n\nIt is for these reasons that I cannot overstate how important it is that we reciprocate Norway's desire to join the free world. Under Article 10 of the OFN Charter, we can expedite their entry into the OFN from months to just days. Given the circumstances in Europe, I doubt you disagree that such an article should be exercised.\n\nYours,\n\nRepresentative Louis Lerner, OFN Liaison to the Kingdom of Norway."

Again speaking to the nation, Prime Minister [NOR.GetLeader] praised the United States, saying that Norway "will no longer cower in the jaws of foreign tyranny."

Shockingly, however, Germania is yet to comment on the withdrawal of its self-touted 'Northern Brother'. Whether the war in the East or a defeatist outlook is the cause of this unusual silence, to many it signals the beginning of the end for Germany's global sphere."

Only through their ascension into the OFN can they ward off any threats from the Reich, be they military or economic. Furthermore, Norway holds vital strategic importance in our fight against global tyranny, being situated just miles from core Reich territory.\n\nIt is for these reasons that I cannot overstate how important it is that we reciprocate Norway's desire to join the free world.

But this is no time to delude ourselves with lies and grandeur while the formerly impenetrable rot seeps. No, now is the time to lick our wounds, both fresh and faded, and ready ourselves to strike again!\n\nWhen our party was forced underground by feeble idealists fifty years ago, did we give up then? When our reclamation of our Eastern lands was challenged by London and Paris, did we let go of our ambitions? No, every time our Reich has faced adversity, we have risen to heights unseen! This time will be no different. Soon, our armies will march across the world once more. Soon, we will achieve victories not even our first Führer could've dreamt.

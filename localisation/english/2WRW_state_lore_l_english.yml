 state_lore_desc.801_unfin: "Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, like much of the former Soviet Union, stands as a husk of its former self; the battleships no longer proudly ring out as they leave port and the dockyards are no longer bustling with life. Life here is harsh, the crumbling buildings slowly succumbing to the freezing winds, salty waves, and brutal snowstorms; the shipments from further west no longer arrive, the pipeline no longer pumps black gold to the tanks, and the ships begin to rust away. The city with a once proud naval tradition now hosts the remnants of the once grand Pacific Fleet, as aging Admirals and desperate sailors turn to piracy to make ends meet, with the port of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky serving as the slipway to their aging ships with fading paint, flying the flag of a country long gone, and the dockyards the host to black market smugglers peddling stolen goods, rather than fishermen and marine engineers.\n\nAs the ships fall further and further into disrepair and the oil begins to dry up, one wonders whether this new age Port Royal will survive for much longer, or, like its predecessor, it will slide into the sea and be lost to history as the vultures of the resurgent far east circle above."

Once, heat itself was an unknown concept among the scattered tribes and disconnected villages moored in subsistence farming. Now, the one who baptizes with fire has lit the region aflame. Empty settlements now ring with Hosannas. Pious tongues cry for mercy, kneeled as penitents in the freezing snow. Famished families feast on the Bread of Life, and they know not hunger.

She is bound to a dirty flagpole, moored in earth once tilled by Katorga and still fertilized by their bones. Above her, the flag of a Fascist State soars through the frigid air. Rarely has she stood watch over crueler circumstances.\n\nBlackshirts march through the city streets in firm lockstep, crushing criminals and protestors alike underfoot. American and Japanese sailors trade stories and bullets over cards. Rousseau’s children hide in humid basements, determined to find a way to break the Vozhd’s iron grip. Drunken mercenaries gather in dive bars that sprout like fungus along the port, forcing their sorrows under a tide of whiskey, vodka, and gin.\n\nMagadan is a city reduced to her circumstances. She wears the skin of democracy, but the blood of countless innocents still drips under her charnel facade. Above it all, Old Glory waves in silence, a symbol of all that could be, and all that is not."

The only sounds are distant gunshots, the smashing of wood, and gargled screams through broken teeth. The only scent is that of drying blood. Paranoia and weeping cloud the lives of the scant few survivors.\n\nFascism has grown in Zeya like a tumor in the breast of a pregnant mother. It metastasized at the hands of the bitter emigres of Harbin, those cowards who fled the Civil War and hatefully festered across the border. When the USSR fell, the seething remnant of the Harbin emigres surged into the Far East, murdering, raping, and pillaging those they called inferior. Zeya has not had a moment of peace since. Her serene mundanity has been stripped away, replaced with the terror of a petty king’s nostalgia and delusion.\n\nSome say that Vozdh Rodzaevsky is trapped in Zeya, a victim of his own creation. Those who offer such musings would do well to remember: §Ran untreated disease will spread.§!"

He has become the seat of power of an ancient and venerable movement: the White Army, the restorationists, those whose honeyed lips bear words of honor and tradition, and who sharpen their blades in his darkened corridors. Chita is a city of contrasts. In the walled manors that sup on the Reka Chita’s banks, noblemen and their retainers riposte subtle political attacks amidst grandiose dinner parties and unwise poker gambits. In his palace, the Tsar paces, guarded every step by the Hetman’s soldiers. Honest laborers crack their spines in half, scrabbling in veins of countless tin and copper mines. Not all return.\n\nTension wafts through the city like manure in a stable. The Zaibatsus grow as mold in a cellar, spreading spores of economic dependency on the wind. The proles grow restless. The nobles grow greedy. The Hetman holds his cards. His opponent is the Tsar, and one may have an ace up his sleeve."

Socialist hymns resound from homes and factories alike. Yagoda’s gaudy propaganda has been torn down, replaced with scarlet banners and icons of Lenin. The assassins and spies that once stalked the back alleyways, abducting victims at a whim, are hanging from lamp posts in the city square.  The old promise “All Power to the Soviets” flits on every tongue.\n\nThe Buryat people are not content to rot under the ever dull Sun. Together with their Russian neighbors, they have transformed their home into a new Leningrad. The Lost Generation has found their place.

Two million human beings labor in perfect harmony and perfect unison, surging forth like grape vines under the tutelage of the vigneron Yagoda. Roiling water pirouettes through the turbines of the grand Irkutsk Hydroelectric Power Station. Truly it is a new wonder of the world, a monument to the urban worker’s labor and determination. No longer will our comrades shiver in the dark. Every apartment in Irkutsk is lit by socialist ingenuity!\n\nHere is a city without starvation or disease. Here is a city ordered, peaceful, and calm.

Neighborhood workshops and backroad farms echo with enthusiastic work songs. The air is tainted by the smell of gunpowder as young men and women practice with their family rifles. A rugged Assembly building is packed with representatives from every corner of the borderlands. The city needs no introduction, for royal titles and fanfare are only for tyrants and statists. It is the city of Kansk.\n\nKansk is in all ways unremarkable, save for the ideologues who inhabit her. She sits on the trans-Siberian railway, huddled on the border between the Far East and the Center. She has few children, and fewer adornments. Yet no city has borne the lash of war with greater resolve, or greater pride, than Kansk. The utter devastation wrought by the Central Siberian War has transformed the coal-mining town into the beacon of liberation. These humble streets and smoke-filled taverns may clear the path to freedom for worker and peasant alike, one that will resolve the contradictions in Bolshevism, achieve social harmony, and root out capital and tyranny alike."

The newly built city Soviet is carved in the style of Kievan Rus. Vivid greens, abyssal purples, and striking reds depict both the October Revolution and the arrival of Rurik’s Varangians in Novgorod. The citizens adorn themselves with ferjazis, caftans, kolpaks, and peasant caps once associated with Comrade Kalinin. Kemerovo has become a city of blinding color, fierce comradeship, and impossibly confused ideology.\n\nIndeed, King Rurik seems to have cast a mystic spell over the city in the aftermath of the Central Siberian Republic’s collapse. Kemerovo has embraced its bizarre reincarnation as a beacon of purpose and sanity. Her vigorous people, and her rich deposits of coal and iron, have made this urbanus the new cultural hub of a kingdom that died seven hundred years ago."

These foolish ignorants have clearly never visited the streets of the majestic jewel of Central Siberia, Krasnoyarsk.\n\nKrasnoyarsk, like many of the old cities in Siberia, received a generous amount of industrial support and funding from the former USSR’s economic planning, transforming it into the premier transportation center for any train, truck, or riverboat maintaining the large population centers of Siberia. Even as the USSR collapsed, its role as the railyard and predominant port city for the Central Siberian Republic couldn’t be ignored. During the Siberian War against the rump state of the Presidium, General Nikolai Andreev would mutiny against the CSR and seize the city, allowing for the last vestiges of free democracy to wither into warlordism.\n\nIronically, the treachery of General Andreev reflects the current situation of the proud transportation hub: a key target for an ambitious successor of Pasternak’s republic, and of the unification of Russia."

The patroness of scientists and artists, she who stood watch for two hundred years. The shining city on a hill, the safe harbor, the arsenal of liberalism!\n\nFair Tomsk has long been a reminder of the resilience of Russian idealism and culture, even during its darkest hours. Home of the venerable Tomsk Polytechnic, the city’s daring intellectual traditions were emboldened by the flight of scientists, philosophers, artists and engineers during the collapse of the USSR. This exodus culminated in the birth of the Central Siberian Republic, under the leadership of poet Boris Leonidovich Pasternak. This Republic did not endure. The Siberian War, fought between the Presidium of the USSR in Irkutsk and the fledgling republic, ended with both polities collapsing into revolt and revolution.\n\nDespite enduring tragedy after tragedy, Tomsk and her people stand defiant. Even in the face of barbarism, betrayal, and terrible injustice, they will not abandon their ambition of a truly free Russia. A new republic is taking shape in the womb of Pasternak’s mind, and this child shall not fall."

In the 20s and 30s Novosibirsk received the lion’s share of funding through the Siberian Plan, enabling it to grow into an economic powerhouse. However, with the fall of the Union, the city’s blessings have twisted into curses. Overpopulation and a refugee crisis have left many impoverished and desperate, with only Barnaul’s grain keeping the city from the brink of anarchy. Drug abuse, radicalization, and expanding wealth inequality contribute to a growing underground of dissidents and criminals.\n\nToday the New Siberia has been consumed by mediocrity, as the last of her lands and natural resources are torn from her bleeding carcass. The citizenry cries louder and louder for change, even as its leadership grows deaf to the shrill screams of the Anarchy. The city of workers needs a hero, or it shall fall forever into the abyss."

Be they saints or scoundrels, all bear a single word on their chapped lips: “Vorkuta.”\n\nVorkuta is a bloated tick. Its head is burrowed into Russia’s flesh, sucking away at a vein of coal. It eats people, stripping away their muscle and will to live until nothing is left save a corpse thrown onto the refuse pile. Once, Vorkuta had a place in a terrible and inhumane system. Once, there may have been a reason for all this suffering, cynical and traitorous as it may have been. But with the collapse of the Union, the hell-city’s coal no longer powers machines of war.

Under its watchful gaze, countless innocents escaped the German columns.\n\nThe third capital of Russia, Lady Catherine’s city, is now the seat of Marshal Rokossovsky’s junta, and the base of the famous 3rd Army. The city is a fortress. To anyone but the most skilled commanders, it is impregnable. Soldiers drill relentlessly in the streets, marching from defensive position to machine gun emplacement hourly. The few IFVs in West Siberia stalk its streets, crushing criminals and infiltrators in equal measure. The civilians too have seen their lives change- under Marshal Rokossovsky’s leadership, the distinction has blurred, and the city Soviet has been utterly disempowered in favor of temporary, emergency military dictatorship.\n\nNo sentry can stand watch forever.

In the early morning, in a time where a forgotten Sun rises to claim its solar throne, the drums beat. On the Sabbath, the drums beat, beat, beat, unyielding and infernal.\n\nAbove ground, Tyumen is nothing but a necropolis, a city holding Lenin’s corpse and civilians soon to be corpses. It is a target waving a red flag. Below the churning earth, Chairman Kaganovich’s servants have dug a labyrinth of booby trapped tunnels and mausoleum barracks. They have marshaled enough industry to drive all of Siberia deaf. But Tyumen is more than a city driven into darkness. It is the new Holy City of Stalinism, and literal thousands have been baptized in its winding caverns. Through cold and hunger, through boredom and tears, they have kept the faith.

Comrade Dragunov’s genius designs have been forged into reality by experienced hands, and in turn those designs have kept the city safe from bandit and cultist alike. Zlatoust is a shining city, unmarred by bomb and bullet.\n\nBut soon, she will be.\n\nEvery child must one day leave her cradle, and Zlatoust is no different.

Even among the hyper-productive cities of West Siberia, Lenin’s Forge remains the most daring and the most industrious. Her factories alone could equip three tank divisions. The Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant still functions, despite Luftwaffe bombings and geriatric age. It remains a prestigious workplace, a symbol of personal achievement for hardworking proles and star-struck teenagers alike, a place that schoolteachers promise their top students will have the right to serve in.

But below the surface, another truth prevails.\n\nDeep beneath the shroud of exhaustion and servility, machinery crashes in tune with marching jackboots. The endless hum of industry deafens its attendants. Teenagers scream as their fingers are torn off in machinery older than them, only to be rushed off the line and replaced without a second thought.

Although the Anarchist communes surrounding Orenburg proudly cherish their freedom and agrarian lifestyle, many more have sought refuge within the city itself, wishing to shield themselves from the raiders and outlaws that stalk the Southern Urals.\n\nThe city of Orenburg burgeoned from an obscure railroad junction for the cities of Central Asia to the diamond of the Ural States amidst the collapse of the USSR. Many Soviet enterprises fled to Orenburg, allowing for its miraculous economic and industrial growth despite the downward spiral Russia suffered in the 50s. Orenburg grew into the center of all South Ural industry and prosperity amidst the devastation to its East, as many who despised Anarchism flocked to the Communes in search of bread, shelter, and some form of government, however minimal.\n\nNow, the city must wield its collective strength in the defense of the innocent. It must reform its failing political system, care for the countless refugees huddling within its walls, and defend the Urals from brutal warlords.

It sees everything, everyone. People disappear- from their beds, from their workplaces, and from their kitchen tables, oats still steaming warm. Everyone has lost someone. First, it was only the homeless and the vulnerable. Diseased children disappeared from nurseries, and the mentally ill from the city sanitariums. Then, the criminals, and the reactionaries.

After the fall of the Soviet Union the city was renamed Theodorichshafen in honour of the Germanic Goths that once inhabited it and heavily settled by the Germans to secure their grasp on Ukraine forever.\n\nBut the tide of Germania was slowly but surely broken up and then decisively pushed back by the Russian forces. Cut off from the mainland, isolated, battered and taken, the pride of the German settlement in the Eastern territories was shattered forever as Russia reclaimed the Crimean peninsula. While it shall take long for the scars of occupation to mend, Sevastopol shall shine once again as Russia’s prime Black Sea port."

 state_lore_desc.87_RUS: "Saint-Petersburg, named after it's creator in the late 18th century, Has been one of the important cities in the history of Russia, being host to some of the biggest icons of Russian culture and being one of the biggest ports for the nation, hosting a massive industry and many shipbuilding yards.\n\nThe city met a terrible fate when operation Barbarossa commenced, It's beauty and population alike completely massacred by the onslaught of German troops and bombs, Twisted into the vison of of it's Nazi conquerors as they worked the remaining Russian populace to death in factories, slowly being replaced by waves of German settlers, the statues of Lenin torn down and replaced by Hitler.\n\nWith the Reich finally pushed out from the east, the city begins (albeit slowly) to return to a semblance of normality, Russians are returning to the inner city to work and Nazi monuments are burnt down and removed. While the city has decades to go before it's importance is reclaimed, The first step has been already taken."

 state_lore_desc.88_RUS: "Originally founded in the 16th century as Tsaritsyn, the city has stood on the Volga river for nearly as long as the region has acted as a bulwark on what was then the frontier of Russian conquest. The importance of the city stood the test of time and it later became a foundation of commercial trade.\n\nFollowing the Second World War, the city was partially rebuilt and used as an administrative center for the German colonial regime. Untold lives were destroyed in the Reich's wake, but as dawn rises over the old Reichskommissariats, the cool air on the river begins to drift into a new direction…\n\nThe old colonial dachas which German aristocrats once lived in are defaced and torn down as their owners are thrown into the street. The Wehrmacht garrison barracks lay silent. Trade and commerce on the river ports slowly rekindle from the ashes of war, unabated by the shadow of the Othala. A phoenix rises over the Volga, with the jackboot unable to stifle its potential."

 state_lore_desc.89_RUS: "Russia is whole once again. With the city of Moscow once again in Russian hands after 30 years of being crushed underfoot by the German occupation, the city of the Third Rome can once again become the Heart of Russia. Ever since the Tartar Yoke had been thrown off and the Russian people secured their independence, Moscow has been at the very centre of Russian civilization. After the disastrous defeat of the USSR the German authorities chose to name the entire colony after the city to further rub salt in the wounds of their crushed enemies.\n\nBut despite the looting, occupation and decades long exploitation Moscow endured, continuing to be a central location for both politics and economics. While its shine faded, the city itself remained unbroken, awaiting its liberation from the German jackboot.As the streets are cleaned up and the last remnants of German occupation destroyed, the first steps towards restoring the city to its former glory are undertaken. A bright new dawn rises over the city of Moscow, as it returns home to its mother country with open arms."

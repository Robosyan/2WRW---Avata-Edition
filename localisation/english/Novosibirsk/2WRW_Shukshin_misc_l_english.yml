 NOV_RAPP_space_category_desc:0 "The true strength of a nation lies not with its soldiers and tanks, but rather with its historical achievements. Whilst many Russian rocket theorists survived the disastrous 1940s, their dreams cannot be realised until now. President Shukshin has allocated funds for the undertaking, and we as a nation must finish what Kurchatov and Korolev started!\n\n§YCurrently, we are§! §G[?RAPP_Progress]% complete§! towards the goals of the current stage. §YEvery month, we will spend [?RAPP_Space_Monthly_Cost] million USD§! which will see us §Ggetting [?RAPP_Space_Monthly]% more towards completion§! on a §Ymonthly basis§!.\n\n§WRemember you can check what's going on on-site via Country Overview!§!"

 Launch_Progressbar_tt:0 "[NOVgetRAPPProgressbar]"
 NOVgetRAPPProgressbar_1:0 "§YSTAGE 1 - SITE CONSTRUCTION§!\n\nAfter careful deliberation, we have chosen a site near the banks of §YSyr Darya§! to construct the §BCosmodrome§!, a research-launching complex dedicated to the §WFed§!§Berat§!§Rion§!'s space exploration projects. We will need significant manpower, money and expertise before anything can commence. Whilst our design bureaus wrap up with rocket designs, §Rthe Cosmodrome must be built§!.\n\n§YWe have currently invested [?RAPP_total_investment] Millions of USD and is currently§! §G[?RAPP_Progress]% complete§!."
 NOVgetRAPPProgressbar_2:0 "§YSTAGE 2 - ROCKET§!\n\nOur design bureaus have come up with viable designs for our manned space flight. However, we have still yet to put the plans into reality. This means assembly, transportation and maintenance of our rocket prior to the launch. In addition, §Yold, Soviet-era infrastructure must be upgraded§! and improved to provide our men with ample amounts of food, water and fuel.\n\n§ROnce we are done, we shall undertake the flight§!.\n\n§YWe have currently invested [?RAPP_total_investment] Millions of USD and is currently§! §G[?RAPP_Progress]% complete§!."

 NOV_RAPP_build_additional_infrastructure:0 "Build Additional Infrastructure"
 NOV_RAPP_build_additional_infrastructure_desc:0 "Though Baikonur is an ideal spot for our Cosmodrome, Soviet-era infrastructure, which initially hampered our efforts in unifying the region, is once again proving problematic. Of course, we cannot forcibly divert all the trains and trucks to the site, so in compensation, new railways and roads must be built to enable faster transportation of goods and people."
 NOV_RAPP_ensure_stream_of_supplies:0 "Ensure Stream of Supplies" 
 NOV_RAPP_ensure_stream_of_supplies_desc:0 "Many talented individuals are not willing to go to the middle of Kazakhstan due to its weather, and lack of sources of food and amenities. These trivial things must not stop the Cosmodrome! Besides, artificially building up the local economy may prove helpful in the long term, as we won't be going any time soon."
 NOV_RAPP_invite_american_experts:0 "Invite American Experts"
 NOV_RAPP_invite_american_experts_desc:0 "The United States has seen many successes in the field of space exploration. Indeed, we must learn from those involved with the construction of American spaceports to understand what it truly takes to raise a bastion of progress from thin air."
 NOV_RAPP_develop_site_procedures:0 "Develop Site Procedures"
 NOV_RAPP_develop_site_procedures_desc:0 "As this is the first time we are building anything like this, many of our managers and workers are still somewhat unfamiliar with all the advanced electronics being shipped in. To avoid accidents on-site, we must reserve some hours and invest them into informing classes so they do not mishandle anything of worth. Aside from that, maybe we can slip some patriotic propaganda into these classes..."
 NOV_RAPP_conscript_military_personnel:0 "Conscript Military Personnel"
 NOV_RAPP_conscript_military_personnel_desc:0 "The Army possesses many young men perfect for the job. As our Federation secures its place among the powers of this world, we expect the coming decades to be relatively peaceful. If the army has no real enemies to fight, they shall waltz with the hot sun of Kazakhstan!"
 NOV_RAPP_develop_local_manufactories:0 "Develop Local Manufactories"
 NOV_RAPP_develop_local_manufactories_desc:0 "Shipping construction materials and electronics from far-off Russian cities are obviously most inefficient. It would be infinitely cheaper if we are able to secure some source of quality materials from Kazakhstan itself. We should seek to use this opportunity to invest in local municipalities, such as Kyzyl-Orda and Zhezqasghan. This may also help with reducing unemployment and promoting urbanisation in these regions!"
 NOV_RAPP_fuck_you_castamir:0 "Disappear the Zvezdograd"
 NOV_RAPP_fuck_you_castamir_desc:0 "The City of Star, as many of our workers call it, is already quite deceptive with its current name, Baikonur. However, some in our government are arguing for additional security measures. These officials claim it is better if Baikonur is wiped off the maps to avoid potential sabotaging from hostiles in Europe and make the purpose of this place clear to its citizens. Honestly, the idea doesn't sound so bad..."

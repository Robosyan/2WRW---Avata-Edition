 NOV_Leonid_Kantorovich:0 "Leonid Kantorovich"
 POLITICS_LEONID_KANTOROVICH_DESC:0 "Leonid Kantorovich has always been a man of numbers. He effectively invented linear programming in 1939, an achievement that the Americans heavily dispute. However, his greatest achievements - and greatest failures - came after the Nazi invasion.\n\nHe was there, at Leningrad, and saw mothers starve to death feeding their children scraps of bread and moldy fruit peels. Kantorovich walked the Road of Life, where he used his knowledge of mathematics to calculate the optimal routes for trucks bearing food and refugees to cross the emaciated ice. He saved countless lives from a barbaric genocide. Still, the number of dead at Leningrad numbered in the millions.\n\nWhen Leningrad fell, he evacuated to the city of Syktyvkar, where he joined the nascent Voznesensky cabinet. That government did not endure, stabbed in the side from the §xLeft§!, the §8Right§!, and from the §eNorth§!. Then, the Federation came to power in West Russia. Kantorovich joined the semi-illegal §xNarodnik§! movement, yet found it infested with the same sort of madmen who animated the Komi Communist Party. He saw in the revolutionaries the same fire that lit Serov's eyes, the same insane rage that sent Suslov back to the Party barracks after his wife's funeral. So, he spoke, and he spoke plainly and rationally about the insanity of continued pretensions at overthrowing the Federation's government. Some listened, and followed.\n\nThough the Narodnik movement has now split between §PKantorovich's reformist Right§! and §xGalanskov's revolutionary Left§!, the Federation is still occupying land that once housed the USSR. Two generations of dyed in the wool communists are not ready to roll over for §gmegacorporations§! and bourgeoisie, however §Bhonorable§! they may be. No, the time has come for change, to draw a line in the sand between the §emurderous Bolsheviks§! and §gslaving capitalists§!. It is time to build a Federation of equals, a Federation of the proletariat, §Pa Federation of justice and plenty.§!"

 NOV_the_kantorovich_presidency:0 "The Kantorovich Presidency"
 NOV_the_kantorovich_presidency_desc:0 "While Vasily Shukshin may have taken the first step in defeating the £GFX_NOV_VRPP_Icon §gReactionary Parasites§! that leech off our Great Motherland, it has become painfully clear that he has no intention of finishing the job.\n\nEnter President Leonid Kantorovich of the £GFX_NOV_DSPR_Icon §PDemocratic Socialist Party of Russia§!.\n\nThough Kantorovich may not contain the revolutionary fervor of §xLenin§! or §eMarx§!, he has sworn himself to the cause of furthering the welfare of Russia's working class. Opposed by the §gcapitalist giants§! on one end and the §gmilitaristic hawks§! on the other, the road will not be easy. But if there's any party that can pull it off in earnest, the £GFX_NOV_DSPR_Icon §PDSPR§! is the one."

 NOV_the_root_of_all_evil:0 "The Root of All Evil"
 NOV_the_root_of_all_evil_desc:0 "Throughout the history of man there has been no greater enemy to the advancement of humanity than Greed, Sloth, and Wrath.\n\nWhile the executives and shareholders of §gSibir, Titan and Feniks§! may rest comfortably now, the working people of Russia will take the battle to there cozy offices and topple the ivory towers built upon the suffering of the working man once and for all.\n\nWhere the §xNarodniks of old§! failed, Kantorovich and Grigorenko will finish what they started. For Russia!"

 NOV_greed:0 "Greed"
 NOV_greed_desc:0 "Whether in food, wealth, or material possessions, the capitalistic leeches that control our banks and run our factories care for nothing more than lining their own pockets with pillaged wealth. No more shall we turn a blind eye to the vampires that suck the blood out of our Motherland and her people.\n\nSibir is the foremost embodiment of Greed. Made strong through Zaibatsu investments and ruthless expansion, the Rotten Bear continues to gnaw at what little freedoms the working class can cling onto. With the help of President Kantorovich and the £GFX_NOV_DSPR_Icon §PDSPR§!, we will finally put down this bloated beast before nothing can resist its hungry jaws."

 NOV_plots_upon_plots:0 "Plots Upon Plots"
 NOV_plots_upon_plots_desc:0 "If we cannot defeat the Rotten Bear with our hearts and minds, then we will beat them at their own twisted game. Blackmail.\n\nWhile the official story regarding the attempted assassination of beloved £NOV_RAPP_Icon §BRAPP§! President Vasily Shukshin pins the blame on a lone crazed lunatic, our private investigators have found certain... connections between said "crazed lunatic" and the treacherous £GFX_NOV_VRPP_Icon §gVRPP§!, supported by a mysterious influx of cash directly linked to Sibir Executives.\n\nBy 'reminding' certain £GFX_NOV_VRPP_Icon §gVRPP§! officials of their party's treasonous activity we can gain the political support of those across the aisle, while also hanging a guillotine above the heads of Sibir should we ever decide to go public with said information."

 NOV_dissuade_the_opposition:0 "Dissuade the Opposition"
 NOV_dissuade_the_opposition_desc:0 "While dealing with those serving the capitalist elite in this manner is not ideal, we are in sore need of allies in high places if we are to force our bills into effect.\n\nThough many in the £GFX_NOV_VRPP_Icon §gVRPP§! and Sibir Corporation see us as nothing more than 'filthy communists', our contacts within the company have eyed out some potentially sympathetic individuals to our cause.\n\nWe will 'persuade' these contacts into siding with the party of the working class through admittedly-dubious legal means, but the ends will justify the means - we're not bombing anyone, at least."

 NOV_poke_the_sleeping_bear:0 "Poke the Sleeping Bear"
 NOV_poke_the_sleeping_bear_desc:0 "The Sibir Corporation is a threat not only to the freedoms of the working man, but the entire Russian Federation. We must make sure our people are aware of just how dangerous the threat of the grain giant truly is, embellishment or not.\n\nIn order to set the stage for a complete dismantlement of Sibir, we must convince the public that such drastic action is necessary in the first place. We will begin a massive campaign initiative to achieve this goal. A call to action from the real patriots of Russia, those who work in the mines and factories for its betterment. United in purpose and in action, we will take the fight to the capitalists just as our forefathers dared to, though this time by peaceful and democratic means."

 NOV_carving_the_beast:0 "Carving the Beast"
 NOV_carving_the_beast_desc:0 "With the revelation of Sibir's involvement in the attempted killing of the §Bformer President§! and various transactions of funds to the £GFX_NOV_VRPP_Icon §gVRPP§! accounts, their stock price has free-fallen to levels not seen since the Smuta.\n\nThe shareholders have seen the writing on the wall, and have agreed to sell their shares in a generous government bailout - or rather, a buyout. However, we aren't ready to nationalize Sibir entirely, though we will keep some stake in it. Rather, we will auction these company assets off at a drastically lower price to the newly formed and §PDSPR-supporting Sibir Industrial Union Federation§!. By peaceful and clever means, we have truly socialized the means of production from this bloodthirsty megacorporation!"

 NOV_sloth:0 "Sloth"
 NOV_sloth_desc:0 "Titan may appear on the outside as the forefront of the Federation's technological innovation, but peering inside the corporate offices reveals anything but. With the end of the Second West Russian War and subsequent end of German hegemony in Europe, new cutting-edge weapons of war are no longer needed. As a result there has been a drastic fall in profit margins, and inside the company headquarters one sees a picture of desperation.\n\nDespite this fact, Titan still frantically clings onto its monopoly on campus grounds and in academic circles. The vast majority of our bright alumni are sucked into Titan's grasp through 'promising opportunities' and 'upward mobility'. Before we can break them completely, we must take away their only advantage with ruthless aggression before our Federation is nothing more than one giant think tank."

 NOV_discredit_the_think_tanks:0 "Discredit the Think Tanks"
 NOV_discredit_the_think_tanks_desc:0 "While we cannot outright buy Titan's power away, we can certainly put in our own word. Militarist sentiment has drastically fallen since the end of the Second West Russian War, and we will use this fact to discredit Titan and their research.\n\nAfter all, why design new tanks or bombs when you can design new state-of-the-art tractors! Military equipment is out of touch with the needs of a modern Russia, and we will make our stance known publicly."

 NOV_free_the_universities:0 "Free the Universities"
 NOV_free_the_universities_desc:0 "Through almost two decades of constant war, our promising students have been sent to the technological frontlines, designing and putting into production some of the world's most advanced - and cheap - military hardware to date.\n\nWhile Titan may have proved crucial in the defeat of the Reich, their stranglehold over our college graduates and their refusal to diversify into a civilian economy must come to an end. Instead of contracts in defense, the Federal government will issue promising scholarships and fellowships in other neglected fields of science, making offers simply impossible to refuse for a curious young graduate. This may hurt our pocketbooks in the short-term, but the gains of innovation for the working man far outweigh a bourgeois notion of the state as a business."

 NOV_balance_the_academia:0 "Balance the Academia"
 NOV_balance_the_academia_desc:0 "Academic studies for far too long have been purely focused on new ways to kill other humans. This cannot continue in our scientific circles.\n\nWe will balance our studies with new innovations in computer programming, agricultural engineering and architecture. By depriving Titan of new concepts, we deprive them of potential future profits."

 NOV_knowledge_unchained:0 "Knowledge Unchained"
 NOV_knowledge_unchained_desc:0 "Our efforts have been fruitful in stripping Titan of its only ace. No longer are the Federation's fields of studies dominated by war and destructive potential. No longer are Russia's colleges chained to the advancement of weapons of killing. We have emancipated our future generations from that fate.\n\nThrough President Kantorovich and the £GFX_NOV_DSPR_Icon §PDSPR's§! efforts, we have saved our brightest minds from the clutches of corporate monopoly. With this crushing blow, Titan will slowly fade into irrelevancy, and eventually be sold off to the highest bidder - and there is no higher bidder than our government, who could use their existing infrastructure for far greater purposes. A sad fate for the executives, but one that just so happens to aligns with our stated goals."

 NOV_wrath:0 "Wrath"
 NOV_wrath_desc:0 "For as long as humans have existed on this earth, we have fought. With rocks, with spears, with bows and muskets, to planes and machine guns. We have always forged new weapons of war to kill each other with. Feniks is the blood-stained symbol of this unfortunate fact. They are the arbiters of Wrath.\n\nWhile Titan is the brains behind the Federation's military complex, Feniks are the muscles. Pumping out hundreds of tanks, missiles and planes in thousands of plants across Russia and her territories. If we are to put an end to their monopoly on arms production - which is no doubt used to generate support for needless foreign wars, we must cut the blood that flows through its veins. Money. They have the support of not only hundreds of shareholders, but our own government. For decades they have received billions in funding to keep our war machine flowing.\n\nPresident Kantorovich and the £GFX_NOV_DSPR_Icon §PDSPR§! have proposed drastic cuts to the military budget's procurement in order to redirect these funds to the much-needed civilian sector. We aren't planning on actually lowering the military budget itself - we aren't §Mpacifists§!, but instead of swords, let the soldiers use their brawn to bring food from the earth, not corpses."

 NOV_boil_away_the_fat:0 "Boil Away the Fat"
 NOV_boil_away_the_fat_desc:0 "Feniks, while being the Federation's foremost defense contractor, is a bloated mess - it's even known as the Feniks Holding Company! Comprising manufacturing plants spreading from Moscow to Magadan, their tendrils spread across our Motherland from sea to sea. We must slowly boil away at the fat that stretches Russia's skin through merciless government trust-busting and buyouts.\n\nNo longer will Russia's shield be wielded by an oligarchy of corporate suits. We will take action into our own hands whether they like it or not - but this will not be easy. Feniks is hated, but breaking laws to buy a few small pieces of the pie is not worth it. We will begin our efforts, but we'll need to find something big, a large excuse to truly go after Feniks."

 NOV_expose_their_skeletons:0 "Expose their Skeletons"
 NOV_expose_their_skeletons_desc:0 "Rumors have been spreading around the current cabinet of certain... misdeeds occurring within the Feniks company headquarters.\n\nWith the proposed bill to reorganize our defense spending encountering more backlash than expected, the £GFX_NOV_DSPR_Icon §PDSPR§! is in need of more than a few skeletons lingering around inside the Feniks company closet if we are to pass the legislation through smoothly. Luckily, we have quite a few investigators that are sympathetic to our cause, or are simply foolhardy prestige hunters. Either way, we can make use of them to find the evil deeds we know these megacorporations are committing. Their iniquity will be shown to the light, and thusly eradicated!"

 NOV_melt_the_slush:0 "Melt the Slush"
 NOV_melt_the_slush_desc:0 "Across all of Feniks's different locations, a wide variety of government-sanctioned military hardware is produced every day. While these contracts have no doubt strengthened our army considerably, it is time we look to other contractors for our military's needs.\n\nWe will melt away our existing obligations in funding and allow those that cannot be simply slashed expire without renewal. Without a constant influx of government funding Feniks will slowly be starved of its main source of income, only further increasing their vulnerability to future efforts against them. But they have no right to complain, it's a free market, after all! We are simply looking for alternatives, if you will."

 NOV_ashes_to_ashes:0 "Ashes to Ashes"
 NOV_ashes_to_ashes_desc:0 "Our biggest ace in the struggle against Feniks has yet to be played onto the field. Their connections to the £GFX_NOV_VRPP_Icon §gVRPP§!.\n\nIt has been discovered that certain high-ranking officials within the party have been involved in a gun-smuggling operation including the support of several Feniks executives.\n\nRussian-made guns are crossing into the North Manchurian Plain and are appearing in the hands of partisan forces operating against the Sphere. Not only does this grossly ignore the authority of the Federal government, it involves Russia into a conflict that has already seen its satisfactory conclusion.\n\nWe will use this information to launch a coordinated attack on Feniks and its £GFX_NOV_VRPP_Icon §gVRPP§! affiliates, severely hurting their reputation among the public and providing the grounds for a full dismantlement in the purpose of trust-busting - and many of its shares remaining can be... repurposed under a government run wage-earned fund. Those responsible will be brought to rightful justice under the lawful eye of the £GFX_NOV_DSPR_Icon §PDSPR§!, putting an end to this wrathful bird before it can inflict anymore harm upon our Motherland."

 NOV_death:0 "Death"
 NOV_death_desc:0 "We have won!\n\nWell, for the most part. Our efforts in curbing the influence of the corporations have proven successful, yet controversial among the public. The revelation of the Sibir plot and the corruption between Feniks and the treacherous £GFX_NOV_VRPP_Icon §gVRPP§! has severely hurt their public opinion, but many misguided reactionaries in the streets still view them as their benefactors.\n\nWith other pressing issues at the forefront of our campaign, we cannot afford to focus on these smear attacks forever. The workers and youth of the Federation still need us, and action must be taken before Kantorovich leaves office, as we're well aware that with our controversial policy, we'll be here for a good time, not a long time."

 NOV_raise_class_consciousness:0 "Raise Class Consciousness"
 NOV_raise_class_consciousness_desc:0 "If their is one barrier that keeps the working class from success, it would corporate power. But just below that would be class consciousness.\n\nThe struggling peoples of Europe have been the victims of endless atrocities, exploitation, and enslavement. We must remind them where the root origin of this issue lies: bourgeoisie exploitation.\n\nWhile Kantorovich is no Lenin or Marx, he is the only chance that Russia has in creating a truly equal society without endless bloodshed. Helping our populace realize this is an important first step towards that goal."

 NOV_through_our_labor:0 "...Through our Labor"
 NOV_through_our_labor_desc:0 "Millions across the Federation and her associates toil in nigh-unlivable conditions for a measly salary that oftentimes doesn't even cover basic necessities.\n\nWe must turn our gaze to the worker's struggle, and provide them with their much-owed dues, not just with government programs that can be taken away or dangled in front of an audience, but via their own power. We will fight for instant card-check, along with a requirement to negotiate a contract in thirty days in a sweeping labor rights bill dubbed by some as the "Automatic Unionization Bill".\n\nWhile the corporatists and fragile strongmen may shriek and pound their desks, they cannot stop progress. With the £GFX_NOV_DSPR_Icon §PDSPR§! in power, the cause of §PDemocratic Socialism§! marches on. With or without the bourgeoisie's consent."

 NOV_blood_and_tears:0 "Blood and Tears"
 NOV_blood_and_tears_desc:0 "We have not forgotten the legacy of the §xNarodniks§!.\n\nThroughout the history of the Central Siberian Republic and their subsequent dissolution into splinter states, the §xNarodniks§! were an influential force for change within Novosibirsk statelet far before Shukshin came to power - though heavily misguided with their calls for anarchistic sabotage and wonton destruction.\n\nThe §gFalcon§! used all and any means necessary to brutally rid his corporate playground of their resistance. From that point on Sibir, Titan and Feniks only continued to exploit those within its touch, and the socialist cause has never truly recovered within the Federation.\n\nThat is, until now.\n\nThe common man is unaware of their suffering. Of their cause. We will make them aware through the voice of the £GFX_NOV_DSPR_Icon §PDSPR§!.\n\nThe past flame of the §xNarodniks§! will be reignited - though very carefully. In propaganda posters, in socialist textbooks, and in our hearts. The biggest voice is that of the ordinary Russian, and by winning them over with our rhetoric, we win the battle for the Federation's future. Surely, these raised expectations won't fire back on us!"

 NOV_sweat_and_sorrow:0 "Sweat and Sorrow"
 NOV_sweat_and_sorrow_desc:0 "The conditions that our laborers work in are dreadful.\n\nWhether it's inside the volcanic confines of a munitions plant, a hazardous coal mine, or a ever-busy hospital, our workers have and continue to suffer inside the workplace.\n\nWe will campaign among our militant allies to fight for their rights through the Automatic Unionization bill proposed by the £GFX_NOV_DSPR_Icon §PDSPR§!.\n\nWhile worker safety laws exist after the §BRAPP§! administration, they are weak and hard to enforce. As socialists, we understand that the strongest fighter for the working man is itself. By dismantling the barriers to unionization, allowing any group with over 50% of its proposed unit to unionize instantly and then require the business owner to immediately negotiate a contract, we can arm the workers with enough tools to fight for their own rights.\n\nThe strongmen and petty tyrants will screech about how unfeasible this makes business, but let them holler. After all, if labor and safety are too expensive for them when the working class can advocate for itself, then their operation is immoral and should be stopped."

 NOV_shield_of_the_common_man:0 "Shield of the Common Man"
 NOV_shield_of_the_common_man_desc:0 "In a society based around capital, the ruling class will always seek to keep the working class down - it's just basic Marxism. While the Automatic Unionization Bill has received widespread support among our militant worker contacts, the £GFX_NOV_VRPP_Icon §gReactionaries§! across the aisle and even our former allies of convenience in the £NOV_RAPP_Icon §BRAPP§! have expressed their views loud and clear.\n\nHowever, our worker contacts, now having led numerous nascent unionization fights, have won organic respect amongst much broader layers of the working class. We can mobilize these contacts with the message that the £GFX_NOV_DSPR_Icon §PDSPR§! is their silver shield against the forces of capitalist exploitations. We are their ally against the dangerous working conditions, the meagre pay, the subpar time off. Let the workers, united in struggle, take to the streets and gain class consciousness by fighting for a real proletarian party against the parties of capital! Every speech, every address by our President, every day in Red Square, let the working class and its fight for it's right to organize!"

 NOV_through_our_teachings:0 "...Through our Teachings"
 NOV_through_our_teachings_desc:0 "The minds of our youth are a malleable substance, manipulated and molded in the ways of our predecessors.\n\nThroughout the past decade, our children have been taught to appreciate the §gcorporations§! and the §gelite§!, to live their lives for the sake of the few. This is a disgrace that cannot be allowed to stand.\n\nWe will reforge our curriculum to appreciate the value of the worker's intelligent spirit and labor. The next generation will be made to value their own work, not in a hyper-individualistic way, but by emphasizing the power of working together as a group.\n\nOur Federation's own teachers will aid in that project. After all, the teachers are unionized in large part thanks to our party's efforts. The suits can complain about the educational curriculum, even those in our own coalition! But they cannot stop union leaders and various militants - unrelated to the £GFX_NOV_DSPR_Icon §PDSPR§!, of course - to simply... emphasize certain concepts more. Let them try to fire every teacher for voicing their humble opinion!"

 NOV_aching_stomachs:0 "Aching Stomachs"
 NOV_aching_stomachs_desc:0 "Thousands of children rest in their beds hungry. Malnourishment is a terrible disease that has long-lasting life outcomes, such as lowered intelligence, weaker muscles, and worse social skills, beyond the human misery it causes. President Kantorovich knows just how horrible hunger is, how painful starvation feels in the bitter cold.\n\nWe cannot allow this state of affairs to stand. President Kantorovich and the £GFX_NOV_DSPR_Icon §PDSPR§! will repurpose more money from our bloated military budget's procurement expenditures and use said funds to kickstart nation-wide food drives. Seized assets from Feniks and Sibir will also be liquidated in order to support our endeavors. Much to the dismay of our rivals in the £GFX_NOV_VRPP_Icon §gVRPP§! and even the £NOV_RAPP_Icon §BRAPP§!.\n\nThe §gReactionaries§! and §BConservatives§! may kick and scream about "defanging our army", but with Kantorovich in power they have a much smaller voice. We won fair and square, let them complain all they want!"

 NOV_empty_bookshelves:0 "Empty Bookshelves"
 NOV_empty_bookshelves_desc:0 "The state of our schools are.. questionable to say the least.\n\nTheir quality has remained relatively stagnant since the reunification of Russia under our banner, and with the Second West Russian War and subsequent dramatic increase in military spending the situation has only worsened.\n\nOur bookshelves are empty, so we must fill them. Funds in the millions will be spent overhauling our education system, with policy crafted by our very own teachers to help guide our hand. No child in the Federation will enter our schools without a fair chance."

 NOV_guardians_of_the_next_generation:0 "Guardians of the Next Generation"
 NOV_guardians_of_the_next_generation_desc:0 "We, the £GFX_NOV_DSPR_Icon §PDSPR§!, are the pioneers of the next generation. Our youth will learn to appreciate the values of socialism - teamwork, goodwill, and hard work, through textbooks rather than bullets, and with the new directives put forward by Kantorovich and Plyusch, through their full stomachs.\n\nThe other parties will have a hard time reversing our benefits should they ever have the reigns again, but our redirection of funds from guns and tanks has received high amounts of backlash from right-wing veterans and cynical corporatists.\n\nLuckily, we are in control of the Presidency. We can make broadcasts to spread our message far and wide, along with our own, now nearly hegemonic, series of contacts within organized labor to speak to their bargaining units about the great policies our £GFX_NOV_DSPR_Icon §PDSPR§! has passed.\n\nMarx argued for a party of the working class. Let's make sure the workers understand just §Pwhich party§! that is."

 NOV_the_next_day:0 "The Next Day"
 NOV_the_next_day_desc:0 "We have done everything we could do and then some, yet it seems the battle has only just begun.\n\nWhile we have slayed beasts "too big to fail" and substantially increased the unionized workforce, dramatically improving the daily life of the working class and students alike, it seems that nothing we can do can cease the consistent right-wing opposition to our noble goals - even from some conservative and misguided workers!\n\nSo what if our hands have gotten a little dirty along the way? If only they knew what life would be like with Primakov in charge. Democracy would truly be shattered, replaced with corporate greed and twelve hour workdays once more. Yet, some veterans do not seem to care, beguiled as they are by the remaining corporate influence in the media.\n\nWhether they accept the reality or not, §Pdemocratic socialism§! has brought new life into Russia, and the Federation has entered into a brave new age. We still have much to do to create a world where exploitation has been defeated through peaceful means, but we've taken the first step, and begun with a firm blow.\n\n§PThe working class will do the rest, in time.§!"

 NOV_Leonid_Plyushch_hog_desc:0 "§YVice President of the Russian Federation§!\n£NOV_DSPR_Icon §PDemocratic Socialist Party of Russia§!\n--------------\nLeonid Ivanovych Plyushch was born on April 26, 1938, in the Kyrgyz SSR. His childhood was marked with sorrow as he contracted tuberculosis at 8 while his father gave his life in the Great Patriotic War. His mother would take him to Central Siberia as Central Asia collapsed to anarchy. He earned his mathematics degree in Novosibirsk, but when work became too scarce he began to publish papers on human biology.\n\nDuring this time he became involved in dissidence networks aimed at ending the Silovik state, but would be incarcerated. Through his served time in the Siloviki prisons his resolve never faltered, and soon he would come to the attention of Kantorovich who took him into his clique. Now finally he is in a position to help the common man and to put his mathematics degree to good use."
 
 NOV_Alexander_Lavut_for_desc:0 "§YMinister of Foreign Affairs§!\n£NOV_DSPR_Icon §PDemocratic Socialist Party of Russia§!\n--------------\nAlexander Pavlovich Lavut was born on July 4th, 1929 to the entrepreneur Pavel Ilyich Lavut, an ebullient figure in 1920s Soviet culture. Lavut would balance a career in education with the troubles of the Smuta, writing in opposition to the Silovik state and advocating for reform in economic management and working conditions.\n\nToday, in the wake of Shukshin's reforms he and his associates were absorbed into the DSPR. Lavut would quickly rise through the ranks before being noticed by Kantorovich himself. Finally, this impoverished teacher may give back to the community without exemption."
 
 NOV_Anatoly_Marchenko_eco_desc:0 "§YMinister of Economic Affairs§!\n£NOV_DSPR_Icon §PDemocratic Socialist Party of Russia§!\n--------------\nAnatoly Tikhonovich Marchenko was born January 23, 1938 in the small town of Barabinsk, just outside Novosibirsk. His parents were of the working class, illiterate and poor. Marchenko left school two years early and soon joined Komsomol. He would later become employed under a local oil drilling company.\n\nThough as a former communist he held contempt for the Silovik state, he would remain silent until turning to the struggle against them as an agitator. Marchenko was imprisoned as part of Pokryshkin's crackdown against the Narodniks, but two years later would escape and detail the conditions of the Siloviki prison system to the public.\n\nWhile Marchenko remained loyal to the cause of the worker, the sweeping victory of the Federation changed his views somewhat, as he saw the success of some aspects of the market - but remained clear on its human failures. Thus, he joined the right-Narodnik movement in the DSPR. Soon, Marchenko came to the attention of Kantorovich, who chose him to lead all matters of the economy. Now the lowly peasant's son is ready to defend the rights of man."
 
 NOV_Petro_Grigorenko_sec_desc:0 "§YMinister of Defence§!\n£NOV_DSPR_Icon §PDemocratic Socialist Party of Russia§!\n--------------\nPetro Grigorenko was born on the 16th of October, 1907, making him one of Kantorovich's oldest staffers. He graduated with honors from Kuybyshev Military Engineering Academy and soon joined the Soviet Army, participating in the battle of Khalkhin Gol among countless others. During the Great Patriotic War, he fought valiantly but was forced into retreat under the command of Marshal Yegorov.\n\nHe soon fled to Komi, aligning himself with its social democrats after experiencing the chaos of political commissars interfering with his soldiers' work, but with the ever changing state of Russia, soon fell to insignificance. This changed with a personal summons from President Kantorovich, and now he has returned to the line of duty, protecting his homeland once more."

 ### EVENTS ###
 DSPR.1.t:0 "A Simple Equation"
 DSPR.1.desc:0 ""My way of thinking is quite simple." The newly inaugurated President Kantorovich took a drag of his cigarette as the television camera trained on him. "Society can be optimized. Life can be optimized. Human wellbeing can be maximized, and quite simply too."\n\nHe waved the cigarette at the audience, sending ash flying onto the coffee-stained studio carpet. "We are not so different, us Russians. We want good lives. Families to care for, and the ability to care for them. A job that gives us dignity, and honest labor. Democracy, so that we can have a say in how our country is run. Now, brothers and sisters, I am not a radical. I have always deplored violence and the revolutionary rhetoric employed by extremists on both sides of the political chasm. But I simply see no reason not to extend democracy to the workplace."\n\nLev Ibramovich, the host, was a middle-aged man in a cheap suit. He narrowed his eyes. "President Kantorovich, I fail to see how this is anything other than a return to Bukharinism. You may have won the popular vote, but your economic policies strike me as simply disastrous."\n\nKantorovich cleared his throat. "You've made quite an elementary mistake, my friend," he said. "Allow me to simplify. When we speak of socialism, we mean something very different than the Bolshevik perception of the economy. Our proposal is to strive for socialization, not nationalization."\n\nHe took a brief puff of his cigarette. "Under Bukharin, the industry was nationalized. It was owned and operated by the government for the government's profit. Our economic policy is socialization - which is to say, that businesses should be owned by those who work in them, and operated for their profit. The data we've uncovered from early experiments are clear. Eliminating exploitative business owners, devolving democracy to the local level, improving education, healthcare, and security - these are the keys to a better life.""

 DSPR.2.t:0 "Ghost of the Past"
 DSPR.2.desc:0 "Petro Grigorenko, the former general, sighed as he leaned against his dacha's window. It was raining outside, a gentle patter that slapped against the glass, beading together before diving to the dirt below. Gray clouds obscured the sun. He hadn't always felt this way - alone, useless, simply sitting around waiting for the hours to pass until he could sleep again. There'd been a time where he'd fought for something, where he'd held to his ideals and done what he could to make Russia a better place.\n\nWhen the WRRF collapsed and collaborators seized the area between Rykov and Samara, he stayed with Voznesensky as Komi declared independence. He and General Opelsin did what they could to transform the meager militias into a real fighting force, something at least able to fend off the bandits and the reactionaries to the south. But even then, Komi was rotting.\n\nGeneral Grigorenko hadn't had much choice of sides, back in the day. Suslov and his maniacs were fanatic, murdering people at the slightest provocation and turning the neighorhoods they controlled into surveillance states. Then there was Bukharina, who was so desperate for socialism that she'd force it down the working class' throat. And Zhdanov... Zhdanov's theories, once you actually dug into them, were beyond the pale. Insanity, nothing less.\n\nSo he'd thrown in with the Komi social democrats. But they were almost no better - committed to democracy, yes, but sacrificing socialism for the sake of a petty alliance with capital. Less murderous, no less tyrannical. And soon after, they allowed gangs of fascists to form. Why? Why not eject the Nazi-sympathizers and the madmen before they gutted the city? The first lynching came only weeks later. And even then, there were whispers that Voznesensky's views of the Komi were no kinder.\n\nSo he faded away. Komi fell, and he went into hiding. He stayed there for years, undiscovered, content in his misery and his debasement. So it was a great surprise when he received an official letter from President Kantorovich, requesting his service as Security Minister."
 DSPR.2.a:0 "It is hard to set aside misery. Harder still, to hope again."
 
 DSPR.3.t:0 "Addition by Subtraction"
 DSPR.3.desc:0 ""There must be a way to make an objective assessment," President Kantorovich argued. "Some manner to mathematically determine which of the beasts to slay first."\n\n"I'm afraid not," Leonid Plyushch, his counterpart in the Duma, said. "There are simply too many factors to make a genuinely objective decision. For better or for worse, we'll have to trust our intuition."\n\nKantorovich shook his head. "How frustrating," he sighed, rolling his eyes. "Very well. I won't allow us to fall victim to decision paralysis. Lay out the choice."\n\nPlyushch placed two manila folders onto the table. "Since Titan is the least politically active megacorporation, the party has decided against breaking up their monopoly first. That leaves Sibir and Feniks to choose from."\n\n"Sibir is perhaps the most dangerous of the megacorporations. As they control the banks, they have the ability to heavily finance right wing opposition efforts, and are most likely to become the focus of bourgeois class-dominance efforts. Since they essentially monopolize our food supply, if they were to turn against our government, the results could be... messy. But beyond that, there are rumors their relationship with Vasily Shukshin has decayed, to the point that the RAPP and their officials are privately feuding."\n\n"The other option is to target Feniks for dismantlement. They are known to openly support the VRPP and numerous minor right-wing parties, including some we consider to be neo-fascist. Not to mention dozens of private union-busters." Plyushch opened the folder, and turned to the third page. "But more importantly, we have evidence that Feniks is trying to find support for a series of international 'interventions' designed to lower trade barriers and allow them to exploit workers in China, the Balkans, and other smaller countries. If we do not dismantle them now, a different party will eventually seize the presidency, and they will certainly use their leverage to begin an endless series of imperialist wars."\n\n"The choice is yours, Mister President.""
 DSPR.3.a:0 "Given their stranglehold over the country's food supply, we will move against Sibir first."

 DSPR.4.t:0 "Exponential Growth"
 DSPR.4.desc:0 "President Kantorovich stood before the Federation Duma, the lines of a carefully crafted speech running through his head. His knuckles tightened on the podium, flaring white beneath the burning spotlight. He took a breath, then began to speak.\n\n"I remember Leningrad," he said. A hush descended on the chamber. "I walked the Road of Life every day, taking the temperature, measuring the thickness of the ice. All to ensure my friends survived the battle." Leonid's voice cracked as his mind conjured up frostbite and pounding artillery fire against his will. "I thought I had good intentions. That I acted selflessly. But when I think of the hours I spent in calculation, the days I spent on the ice, I wonder if it was an act of charity, or a distraction from the hunger."\n\nKantorovich removed his glasses, and began to rub his forehead. "I am not the only survivor of the Siege of Leningrad. There are others who can tell the stories, share the memories, better than I. But all of us will tell you the worst part was the hunger."\n\n"Stopping yourself from filling your belly, so you'd have enough for the next day. Hunting rats in the sewers. Watching your loved ones grow thin and pale, seeing their hair fall out, their fingernails loosen and crack. No, the bombings were not the worst part - the worst, most scarring memories of that time were of starvation."\n\n"There are objective reasons to support this bill. The economic benefits are clear, as Mister Plyushch has informed you. The societal and cultural benefits are calculably significant. I like to think of myself as a rational person. Perhaps I've even proved it. But, representatives, when I made the decision to assist in drafting this bill, my thoughts were not of statistics and abstract benefits. They were of the Siege of Leningrad, the pain I saw etched in the face of toddlers barely able to walk, and how I would do anything to stop that from happening again. Not to my people. Not anywhere!""

 DSPR.5.t:0 "Pass the Salt"
 DSPR.5.desc:0 "Lev Morozov handled his steak as though he were a surgeon operating on his own mother. His serrated knife glided through the garlic-butter basted fat, slicing an infinitesimally thin piece away from the bone. He lifted the portion, admiring the elegant marbling like a jeweler inspecting a fresh-cut diamond, and placed it onto his tongue. Lev smiled, and swallowed. "I love this restaurant. Why don't we come here more often, Leonid Ivanovych?"\n\nPlyusch hadn't even touched his lobster. "There are more important things in life than needless luxury."\n\n"Luxury? My friend, food is not a luxury. It is a necessity. And why not love your necessities?" Lev took a second bite of his steak. "I'm glad you've come. Although I suspect not for the pleasure of my company."\n\n"No, I'm afraid not." Plyushch folded his hands on the table. "Lev, the DSPR doesn't have the votes to pass the bill on our own. We need support from the other parties."\n\n"You want the RAPP's support? After you beat Shukshin? I don't think many of us will be interested in what you have to say."\n\n"But you should. If only for our friendship."\n\nLev paused in the middle of cutting his steak. A potent mixture of cooked blood and liquid fat pooled on the edge of his knife, dripping onto the porcelain plate. "Fine. But only because you joined me for dinner."\n\n"Passing the bill is in your best interest," Plyushch said. "You're a rational guy, Lev. That's why you decided to back Shukshin back in the day. Listen - this bill Kantorovich introduced? It's a gigantic subsidy for independent grocers and small farmers. Take a look at some of the tax incentives we sprinkled in. If you come over to our side, your constituents in Bashkortostan will end the year richer, happier, and fuller than ever. We pass one of our platform planks, you look like a reasonable guy willing to compromise - everybody wins."\n\nLev took another bite of his steak. "Seems too good to be true." He dabbed his napkin against his lips. "I want an extra tax break for farmers in Bashkortostan and Tatarstan. Give me that, and you'll have my vote.""

 DSPR.6.t:0 "The Fruits of Our Labor"
 DSPR.6.desc:0 "Kristina was cold, and tired. Miserable, filthy, greasy, she walked the streets of Kansk aimlessly. She was lost, without a home, without a purpose. Often, she wanted to die. But worst of all was the gnawing in her belly.\n\nIt's difficult to describe starvation if you haven't experienced it. It is not constant, but periodic, and it affects everyone differently. First, you lose control of your emotions. You swing from incredible sadness to irrational anger without reason. Then, your stomach twists itself in knots, gurgling and ripping itself apart in search of food. You feel as though a knife is twisting in your gut. Then comes an exhaustion - physical, mental, spiritual, an exhaustion so deep you feel as though you might pass out where you stand. Your brain numbs, and your higher thought strangles. But worst of all is that this is not constant. It comes in waves, like the tide, crashing over you, filling your lungs to bursting. Then, it recedes, and you have time to contemplate your slow death before the symptoms come again.\n\nKristina knew this, intimately. Hunger had been a part of her life since she'd been thrown out of her family's home. Abandoned, she scrounged through garbage, did odd jobs, or begged just for what she needed to survive. Not that she wanted to, but she couldn't find a job without a home to shower in or receive money at, and she couldn't find a home without a job. Why she kept going through the motions of life, she wasn't sure. Perhaps her lizard brain had simply seized control, forcing her to keep the disgusting apparatus of her body alive as part of some misbegotten evolutionary conspiracy. Whatever the reason, she lived. But she was alone, truly. No one - not even the people who'd created her - gave a damn if she survived.\n\nThat's why she was so surprised when a government agent stopped her on the street. "Excuse me, ma'am?" the young man said. Christ, he was just a kid - barely seventeen if she could tell. "We're going through the city handing out food vouchers. You can redeem them at any grocery store. These should be enough to last you a month or so-"\n\nShe snatched the bundle out of the worker's hands. "Yeah, and what's the angle?""

 DSPR.7.desc:0 "Dear Mr. Kantorovich,\n\nYou do not know me, nor am I your friend. However, we share a common enemy: those who scalp and enslave the Russian people. The enemy has three heads, as you know. It also employs a wide variety of tactics which you will find quite interesting. Below, I have attached several photos, invoices, and communiques. Please see Attachment A first - it is a summary of the evidence gathered thus far. You will find it quite fascinating, to say the least.\n\nATTACHMENT A: GENERAL TIMELINE\n\n1) Sibir Cereals and Farm Supply CEO Kira Arsenyev is ordered by the Board of Directors to deal with political opponents after the surprise election of Vasily Shukshin against Alexander Pokryshkin. One month passes.\n\n2) Mrs. Arsenyev begins outreach towards known assassins in the area that can handle high-stakes, high-value targets. She successfully contracts one Mahmud Barat, a Chechen assassin of high repute. A deal is struck near the end of the month.\n\n3) Mr. Barat waits until the post-election motorcade, two months after the election, before striking.\n\n4) 9:41 AM - Mr. Shukshin's motorcade starts 11 minutes late. It passes without incident.\n\n5) 9:55 AM - Mr. Barat enters an abandoned building's top floor, a mile away from the site of the motorcade as late as he can to avoid detection. (see EVIDENCE F)\n\n6) 10:00 AM - Mr. Barat fires upon Mr. Shukshin when he goes to wave to the crowd, but misses due to a sudden wind acceleration in the long distance and hits his arm. He fires into his bodyguard and the car. In total, he fires four shots.\n\n7) 10:01 AM - Mr. Barat disassembles his weapon and flees. (see EVIDENCE G)\n\n8) 10:15 AM - Mr. Barat contacts Mrs. Arsenyev about the operation failure.\n\nGiven your interest in disempowering these individuals, I believe we have a mutual interest. It would be a shame for Mrs. Arsenyev, and Sibir, if these items were to get out."

This comes after last night's reports of the discovery of a conspiracy to assassinate former President Shukshin after his upset victory against Alexander Pokryshkin several years ago. We're now live with the Novosibirsk Head of Police."\n\nThe scene switched to an official-looking building downtown. A large and serious man faced microphones and camera flashes like a prisoner facing a firing squad. Jan stared as his toast began to burn. "We can announce that we have taken the majority of the Board of Directors into custody as suspects in the assassination attempt on former President Shukshin. We cannot comment on anything else at this time." At the bottom of the screen, a ticker read reports on today's stocks market. Sibir itself was down by twenty percent, their subsidiaries an even greater amount. The market itself was on the verge of crashing.\n\n"Quick work from the Novosibirsk police," the newscaster said, "and it seems there will be no bail allowed by the new Solicitor General, who claims that there is a significant risk of flight. This just in - President Kantorovich is now holding a press conference on the issue. Lets tune in."\n\n"Sir!" yelled a reporter in the heated press conference.

 DSPR.9.t:0 "The Plyushch-Kantorovich Plan"
 DSPR.9.desc:0 "BLACK PAPER - NOT FOR RELEASE\n\nThe Plyushch-Kantorovich Plan, otherwise known as the wage-earner fund, is our plan to firmly place the working class in control of the economy through peaceful means. It is, in short, our plan for the socialization of the tools of production in Russia.\n\nThe basic idea is simple: with the right political conditions, we will pass a bill that taxes a percentage of large company revenues and places them into a wage-earner fund. The fund will purchase shares from said company and turn them over to the ownership of independent labor unions. Within decades, give or take a few years, said unions will have enough shares to own the company, and claim management for itself. A true socialization of the commanding heights of the economy, run for and by workers.\n\nWith the recent chaos in Sibir, we will execute a test purchase with the newly formed unions. The unions are currently too new to be able to solely manage these funds, nor is the political climate prepared for such a socialistic policy in full. We expect with some liberal debt usage, we will be able to purchase about 20% of open shares on behalf of the Sibir Industrial Union Federation (SIUF). With the conglomerate in chaos, this places the SIUF leadership as an influential member of the board, and will be able to swing votes with the now far more distributed share distribution.\n\nWe believe that if the SIUF can grow and secure their bargaining units, along with a general increase in union density and other organizations for workers in the broader economy, the political situation will begin to change in our favor.\n\nOur benchmarks for this are union density of 40% for a general industrial union organization to be able to lobby for laws. Upon reaching a union density of 60%, we believe the law will be passable, if the unions can effectively mobilize. As of now, the wall-to-wall unionization of the entire Sibir conglomerate has single-handedly increased the union density from 7% to 28%, an increase of 21%. Future expansion may occur with Titan or Feniks, should the situation arise."

Have lost someone you loved?"\n\nIn the Duma, the crowd was silent, for all had experienced loss. The Russian anarchy had caused untold devastation, such that everyone in that room had faced something horrible in the thirty continuous years of war and terror.\n\n"In rural Komi, after the Republic fell, I saw a little girl walking in the streets, with her little shoes full of mud that caked her calves. When I went to her, do you know what she told me? She told me that she had no place to go, and that she had to go to school so that the teachers might give her crackers. Her walk was five miles through mud and unexploded ordinance that had slaughtered another child the week before. Ambling, lost in the world, she trudged on. When she raised her thin arm, I saw a crater where once was a child. Can you imagine your daughters or sons, at ten years of age, walking like that for some crackers at a school that may not exist?"\n\n"The good soldiers of Russia want to help their fellow citizens from experiencing such terrible loss alone.

He raised his hands and dramatically raised up a finger to begin his next point.\n\n"One! Our administration calculated the economic and societal benefits that putting soldiers towards infrastructure would have in the short and long term, and they are overwhelmingly positive. Two!

A DSPR representative.\n\n"...just think about all of the people living in squalor now after the war. What use do they have for bullets now that we've already won? We have made our borders secure. Our position is undisputed. To put it simply, this bill will help millions in the west that have been affected by the war, as opposed to... what? More guns? I'm sure that will help the thousands of souls still sleeping outside their former ruined houses from the war. It's time for the military to hold its guns and pick up some hammers."\n\nThe anchor cut in, his voice as polite as ever. "I see. Now, from what we've heard it seems the bill is seeing a lot of pushback from the RAPP and VRPP. Former President Shukshin has voiced his disdain for the bill, calling it 'extreme' and 'unwarranted'. What say you?"\n\n"He's our former president for a reason. The DSPR won the elections with an agenda at hand, and we will seek to accomplish it, just as Shukshin accomplished his own goals.

This was where Kantorovich and his ministers met to plan, calculate, and theorize. Vibrant and educated political discussions could be heard bouncing off the walls as the smartest and most socially minded people in Russia charted the nation's course. At least, that was the idea. As of now, all eyes looked worriedly at a television.\n\nOn the screen were modest crowds, lined with people in black hoodies, red flags, bleached hair, and other tell-tale signs of youth and radicalism. It was nothing new, it was strange to even see it on the news. However, immediately the room could tell why it was being shown when they read the bar below it: "Leftists, Pacifists Rally Behind 'Swords into Plowshares' Bill". Kantorovich's minister assigned to the bill, a short and stout man with a keen intellect and powerful speaking voice, chewed his nails as they stared at the screen.\n\n"We're live now with one of the demonstrators," a reporter was now on the screen, in front of a man in a park, "you can see here how he's holding a sign saying 'Give Peace a Chance'. Could you tell us all about what you mean by that?"\n\nThe young demonstrator, a gangly man with curly long hair reaching down to his back, smiled. "Well, we support world pacifism and peace. It's pretty simple."\n\n"Now according to President Kantorovich, this bill would not significantly reduce military spending, and would not weaken the military. How do you square that with your pacifist values?"\n\n"This is just the first step!" the man shouted. Several other youths with communist and anarchist paraphernalia walk by. "It is the first step towards disarming the country and ending imperialist wars. First this small reduction, and later everything else!"\n\n"That says it all.

Well, his missing legs.\n\nHe joined the Moscow Veterans Interest Association a few weeks ago when the talk about a bill to defund the military started getting around. Sasha wasn't a raving lunatic, mind you. He didn't like war one bit, and he knew the price of battle better than anyone. Still, he had seen enough to know this whole pacifism thing went too far. That's how he ended up rolling down Bolshoi Bridge on a Saturday morning.\n\nSasha had never seen such a large crowd in his life. They walked, or rolled, or ambled on crutches, on the bridge. Many were shouting slogans that organizers from the MVIA had memorized and distributed. From megaphones, they shouted "Hear our voice! Defend our homes!" and other nationalist slogans. The roar of the crowd exhilarated Sasha as they echoed it back to him.\n\nOnce the group reached Zardarye Park, the march turned into a rally as several speakers came out against the 'Swords into Plowshares' bill.

They say that the troops will remain, but where does the money they spend on rebuilding a road in Siberia come from? The weaponry they need to defend us! What's the use in soldiers with no guns?!

Popularity is fickle. It comes and goes. It can be ignored or distracted." He stood up from his chair. "Comrades, I do not intend to give up a major policy plank due to a media frenzy. The television stations, and the radios: they are owned by the megacorporations, who in turn are owned by the bourgeois. Their class interests are opposed to our own. As long as they exist as private entities, they will smear us and our goals."\n\nKantorovich removed a cigarette from his coat pocket. "We will slow the campaign, but not drop it. Move the education funding bill into the spotlight." He flicked open a lighter, and the cigarette flared to life. "We've seen how businesses have broken the Federation's laws in the past. Direct the Solicitor General to investigate the Feniks Corporation. We will scour their bank accounts, their tax returns, their customs patrols, all of it! Once we find one error, one misplaced zero, one inflated deduction, then we will unravel the whole rotten string of fraud."\n\nA trail of smoke bled from Kantorovich's mouth.

No. They sent me: Kirill Davidovich Baranov. I do the tough nuts, the dirty cases, the ones that go cold.\n\nIt was a muggy, humid night when I went out into the streets of Zeya. That's just how it is, reassigned hundreds of miles from Krasnoyarsk to follow a lead on the Japanese border. A small light, flickering on and off, drew me in, like a moth to a flame towards an old office building, some accounting firm: 'Zeya Accounting Solutions'.\n\nOkay, it's more like I had the warrant to investigate it for some shady numbers, bite me.\n\nOut of the corner of my eye, as I was going in to knock on the door, I heard voices inside in hushed tones.

They too, would fail, just like every other attempt at communism.\n\nYet, as the hours passed, his thoughts turned bleaker. Even if these dogs left, more were out there. Boots reverberated continuously throughout the house. All the newspapers said he was wanted. There was no escape.\n\nHe was thirsty, hungry, and had to use the bathroom. Reduced to misery, to shitting in his little hovel, would they find him like that? He wasn't going to somehow sneak past a continuous watch, make it from Novosibirsk to Manchuria while evading detection. So, reluctantly, Iosef undid the hatch leading up to the spacious area behind the sink in his master bathroom. He stepped out with bleary eyes, right into a chain that rattled, echoing like an explosion through the empty house. A moment passed in the echoes of the rattle. Then, boots came running, and Iosef's face met the tiled floor."

Well, maybe not as fun as playing ball or going on a date, but school was enjoyable. The teachers seemed much nicer and the rooms were clean and tidy. The chairs weren't made of splintering wood, but of metal with smooth seats and desks with little divots to place your pencils. Alina's first class was Russian History. While she didn't like it as much as math, it wasn't too hard if you did your reading.\n\nSitting at her desk was Miss Petrov. Miss Petrov always carried a cup of coffee with her that she nursed in her hands. She was kind when you had questions, but, like right now, she could get exasperated when people didn't answer her questions.\n\n"Class, I need your cooperation if we are going to learn together.

They are far from minor."\n\n"Mr Kantorovich, many of us fear that seeking treatment would cause us to lose our jobs, since we would be unavailable for days - or weeks if we need surgery. Even with the healthcare reforms, we don't get paid for taking the day off. We don't mind not getting paid on days we don't work, but we don't want to risk unemployment simply because we go to the doctor."\n\n"This needs to change, Vasily. I will look into it. You will be able to see the doctor, I will do all I can to make it so."\n\nKantorovich pondered as he was driven back to his office. The solution was simple - implement legislation to protect workers' rights against at-will employment, alongside increasing funding for a more robust healthcare system that was more extensive and affordable without a significant compromise on its quality.\n\nThe main issue was funding. Sure, the coffers of the Federation were currently rather large, but such a measure was no mere stimulus package. It would require significant political wrangling and a consistent flow of money to sustain and improve upon Russia's healthcare infrastructure and enforce any law banning arbitrary firings.\n\nHe could cut deals with key representatives and with his own bloc, could definitely get the legislation he needed enacted. But the same question still went unresolved - who or what would fund this massive expenditure?\n\nPerhaps he could raise corporate taxes? They were already quite high, and while Kantorovich didn't particularly feel bad for the corporations, too high and the corporations would simply move. But with some packaged laws on capital flight..."

He held firm to the hand railing, releasing it only to discover a revolting amount of dust and grime had painted his palm, which he hurriedly wiped off. A final violent shake indicated the elevator had reached its destination, and Ilyich stepped out to a musty cave filled with smoke. He coughed and desperately held a handkerchief to his mouth to clear his lungs of the smog as he began to wander through the mine.\n\nHe quickly found the punch clock station and began to inspect the time cards. The sight they revealed was not a pleasant one, as with every card harsher hours appeared, none less than twelve a day. He returned them with disdain, marking them on his report. As he continued deeper into the mine, the smell of sweat and taste of coal only grew stronger, making Ilyich nearly gag. Eventually he reached an active section of the mine where workers sat on break. They looked nearly dead, and their clothes were falling apart at the seams. Ilyich's coughing alerted them to his presence, though many still on shift barely noticed him as they continued to shatter the cavern's walls.\n\n"Oh, look at the company man in his fancy little suit! Come to crack the whip a little harder?" One jeered as others joined in.\n\nIlyich attempted to remain formal as he replied, "Comrades, please, you needn't worry. Know that I represent your best interests. I've come to your place of work as a representative of President Kantorovich, here to-"\n\nAnother miner scoffed. "That's the same jargon from the suits that own this damn mine. I voted for Kantorovich and we haven't seen shit, so where the hell are our better hours, or more time off, or some cleaner air?"\n\n"No one wants to hear your excuses! If you want to help us, why don't you pick up a shovel?" The mine roared as more continued. Ilyich resigned his pleas and began to walk off as more insults and taunts followed him. Some spit or threw dirt as he walked past, while others only stared with empty eyes before returning to their duties. Ilyich wrote concluding remarks to his report before dusting off his suit and hastily returning from the depths."

After several minutes of meticulously observing every word, he got up and began to walk into the Duma. He set up at his podium, laid out his several papers, and began speaking. During his speech, he eyed several senators who all seemed to grow angrier with each word spoken.\n\n"And with this Hunger Task Force, we intend to eradicate the inequality of food between urban and rural communities. There is no reason one community should stand idly by as their 'superiors' engorge themselves. Once more, I emphasize the importance of such a governmental body, not just to feed our people but because it's good policy, I've mentioned all of the increases in efficiency from minimizing malnutrition." As Kantorovich finished his speech a member of the VRPP stood up and demanded, "And where will the funds for this 'Task Force' come from?"\n\nKnowingly, Kantorovich stared at the bureaucrat and replied, "The DSPR plans for the funds to be acquired from the already liquidated corporate assets-" before Kantorovich could finish he was stifled by the same senator who yelled, "Why not cut funds from your other socialist pet projects? Instead you want to destroy businesses?" Amused, Kantorovich asked, "Is there a reason you demand me to not use these liquidated assets?" Before the senator could speak a member of the RAPP interjected, "I believe what he means to say is that why can't gather the funds from other avenues, like the multitude of new social programs in existence?"\n\nAs the argument dragged on Kantorovich grew more and more infuriated by the incessant barking from the members of the RAPP and VRPP. Despite his best attempts to get a word in edge-wise, it simply wouldn't be possible to pass even this basic bill, even this minor increase in social spending, with the RAPP and VRPP. The reporters would pounce like jackals on this, but he had no choice. They'd rely on their tried and true strategy: get the RSLP and left-wing parties to vote with them, down the line, for the bill."

 DSPR.32.desc:0 "The TV's sound cut in and out, rhythmically interrupted by static as Yevgeny and Andrei sifted through endless channels to tune in for the play-offs between the pair's favorite hockey teams. While Russia had only very recently found the time to broadcast the small, yet engaging, events on live television, that only made it all the more exciting to get them so regularly. As the two teenagers continued to surf the channels, they heard the same monotonous talk of politics that had plagued their screens since they'd first turned them on but they paid little attention to what was said.\n\n''I'm telling you, the Siberian Falcons are going to dominate the play-offs,'' Yevgeny bragged as they continued to click through the channels.\n\nAndrei scoffed. ''Not with how they've been playing lately. They've only had one or two point lead wins every game this season. No, The Ural Crusaders are going to smash them in the finals.''\n\nTheir argument was interrupted by a shared cheer as the buzzing of a hockey stadium indicated they'd reached the channel, however the broadcast was cut short by a voice they only barely recognized. ''Good Evening to you all. My name is Leonid Kantorovich, President of our great Federation. I apologize for the interruption, but as millions sit ready to watch our nation's greatest athletes compete, I feel now is the time to address many of those anxiously awaiting the competition.\n\n''As I speak, a new generation of Russians are preparing to propel this country forward. It will be your duty to someday lead our nation into the future, one which cannot succeed without you. Our Federation is not without its flaws, and it will be up to you to work towards mending them. With your perseverance and will, I have the utmost faith you will be the ones to lead Russia to greater heights and future glories. Until then, goodbye, and enjoy your game.''\n\nThe screen soon cut back to coverage of the stadium, but they paid little attention as they reflected on the president's words. Perhaps, they decided, they would return to the channels they had ignored for so long, and truly listen to their words. Their patriotic vigor inspired a brief toast to their motherland before they returned their attention to the game."

Down with the traitors!"\n\n"We haven't seen shit, where are our jobs?!"\n\n"The President wants to destroy Russia's military! We will not let him!"\n\nHundreds of signs bearing a variety of similar messages waved throughout the crowded streets, parallel to the winding maze of chambers and quarters where the DSPR called their headquarters. An array of All-Russian Patriots clashed against a thinly-held line of Assembly guardsmen. They would eventually disperse given time, but for now the mob firmly stood in place. Always shouting, always wanting.\n\nGrigorenko placed his hand on Kantorovich's shoulder, sitting himself next to the aging mathematician while he looked out to the crowd in anxious concern.\n\n"They're still out there, huh? It's been a couple hours since noon. I wonder how long their spirits will last for."\n\nThe President turned to face his minister, eyes racked with exhaustion.\n\n"I don't understand Petro. What haven't I done for Russia that they think those traitors in the VRPP will? It isn't rational, their calculations are all wrong."\n\nGrigorenko lifted a glass from the small table in-between them, forcing it down in a single sip.\n\n"We've been too naïve Leonid. Trying to force all of this so quickly. You know Primakov and his base won't just disappear overnight, even with the Sibir Manifesto and those smugglers exposed. The Falcon and his corporate stooges have had their tendrils in our Motherland since those troubled days in Siberia. Give it time, Mr. President. That's all we can do, after all."\n\nAs the sun began to set across the Federation and the skies above the capital fell silent once more, Leonid Kantorovich lifted his own glass into the air."

It landed with a dull thud.\n\nAmet-khan smiled, and punched him in the shoulder. "Were you aiming that at Kantorovich, or the squirrels?"\n\n"Both. Neither." Shukshin grimaced. "He won the election. He won the votes. He deserves to be President."\n\nAmet-khan raised an eyebrow. "But?"\n\n"But his proposals are dangerous. You know I'm no socialist, my friend. Kantorovich and his party are radicals who want to tear up everything this Federation was founded on. Half of them haven't even renounced the acts of terrorism they committed in the sixties!" He held up a finger, silencing Amet-kahn's reply. "And I know Pokryshkin's response was wrong. Illegal, to boot. But two wrongs don't make a right. We can't go back to the Soviet Union."\n\n"And if that's what the people want?"\n\nShukshin frowned as his elbow twinged in pain. Age had not been kind to him, especially amidst the fear and horror of the war. "Democracy is not a mob movement. The majority rules, but must respect the rights of the minority. That means property rights, too. We cannot legalize thievery. We cannot legalize thuggery."\n\nIn the distance, a bird began to sing. The pair of friends paused as they walked down the forest trail, listening. Their bodyguards kept a respectful distance.\n\nAmet-khan smiled as the bird's chorus twirled through the air. "I'm sorry you lost the election, Vasily. I wish there was something I could've done."\n\n"No matter. It's over with." Shukshin closed his eyes, contemplating. Remembering the moment so many years ago when he sat next to the Ob, merely the mayor of Barnaul, watching trash and human waste flowing down the heart of his homeland. The moment he turned against the Siloviki system. "And there will be another election. I trust Kantorovich on that. If we win, good. If not," he sighed, smiling sadly, "then I can retire in this beautiful country. And be proud I did everything I could for my people.""

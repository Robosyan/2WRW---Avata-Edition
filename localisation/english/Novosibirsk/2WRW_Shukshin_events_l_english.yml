 Shukshin_unification.1.t:0 "A New Dawn"
 Shukshin_unification.1.desc:0 "Vasily Shukshin sat at his desk. Novosibirsk was much colder than Barnaul. It was larger, louder and much busier too. It seemed to correspond with his current position as the President of the Federation. He had the Siloviks in his left ear and the corporations in his right. All day, 24/7. Vasily didn't like the job. As a matter of fact, he despised it. At times, he wished he was back in Barnaul, challenging Pokryshkin and backing minor reforms. To Shukshin, that was much easier to deal with than his current situation.\n\nDespite his recent efforts, there was still much to do. Hell, there was an entire system that needed to be overhauled and reformed if the Federation was to ever become a truly free and democratic nation. The Siloviks were putting up stiff resistance at every turn, doing everything possible to halt the reforms and to overrule the soon-to-be founded Federal Assembly.\n\nFor decades, since breaking away from the failed Central Siberian Republic, the Siloviks under Pokryshkin had been in power. They made the Federation what it was. A land where the 'Strongmen' had complete rule of the people, pocketing the cash and ignoring the damage they had done. His Federation would be different, however. It wouldn't be like the misplaced idealism of the failed CSR and It wouldn't be like Pokryshkin's cynical Federation. It would be a different kind of Federation."

 Shukshin_unification.2.t:0 "Pragmatism and Democracy"
 Shukshin_unification.2.desc:0 "Vasily sat at the head of a table. In front of him sat his Presidential cabinet. His foreign minister, Vladimir Sobolev. His economic minister, Mikhail Kerchenko, his security minister and old friend, Amet-khan Sultan and the Vice President and opposition leader, Alexander Pokryshkin. Vasily cleared his throat before reaching for a set of papers on his desk.\n\n"Gentlemen. It's good to see you all today. I know you all have busy schedules so, I'll keep this brief. The Federation, as you know, doesn't just encompass Central Siberia anymore but all of free Russia. In line with this new reality, I think it's time we reform the government into something more pragmatic to accommodate the Federation's needs" the President explained.\n\nHe received three nods in agreement but of course, his Vice President was quick to object. "Mr President, you can't be serious! This is just another attempt by you to subvert the Siloviki and you damn well know it!"\n\nAmet went to raise his protests but Vasily rose his hand, stopping the Ace from doing so.\n\n"I understand your reservations on this, Alexander but even you must admit, the current system is overextended and in dire need of change."\n\nAlexander opened his mouth to speak but stopped and leaned back in his chair.\n\n"The Siloviki won't like this, Vasily" the Falcon reminded his old friend.\n\n"I don't expect them to, Alexander but it has to be done. For the good of the Federation, right?" Vasily replied.\n\nAlexander sighed, shaking his head before looking back at the President."
 Shukshin_unification.2.a:0 ""Alright, old friend. For the good of the Federation.""
 
 Shukshin_unification.3.t:0 "The Cards Begin to Fall"
 Shukshin_unification.3.desc:0 "It had been mere weeks since the Smuta was brought to an end by the Federation under his command, yet Shukshin was already stirring at his desk restlessly after hours of being unable to find a path to his dream of a truly free Russia. While democracy had been theoretically in place in Pokryshkin's Federation, it was at best a lackluster excuse for one. The legislature had no real power, bound by endless arcane statues and codices from arbitrary presidential speeches. He had barely scraped into leading the Federation in this system from Pokryshkin's own hubris, and it was now his job and his job alone to fix it, though he knew it would not be easy.\n\nIt had been hours of nothing but toiling and unsuccessful ideas on how to mend this rotting system until Shukshin finally came to a new realization. He finally snapped from his his stupor, realizing at last how he could finally fix the broken system laid in front of him, how he could put the failings of Pokryshkin and the Siloviki behind him, how the systematic corruption in the systems of the Federation could be abolished - but not conventionally. No, they had to build a new constitution, a pluralistic system of coalitions. With his new epiphany at the foot of his mind, Shukshin painstakingly prepared his work and proposals to finally be unveiled, and for the robber barons of Russia's past to finally be behind them.\n\nShukshin rushed to the Duma building from his office, calling an immediate emergency meeting. The restoration of the nation's hope could wait for nothing and one. As the delegates settled in, irked by the President's sudden summons, Shukshin began to make his announcement to the Duma and to the nation.\n\n'Today, I hereby announce that new parties will once again and forever be allowed to establish themselves. No longer will the archaic and feudal system of ‘democracy' that Pokryshkin allowed to continue. The executive branch of the Federation will no longer be an omnipotent dictator, and its powers will be limited by a true constitution and reformed legislature of the Federation.' The whole of Russia had seen his declaration of intentions, and even the Siloviki could not stop a movement with the backing of a whole nation behind it."
 Shukshin_unification.3.a:0 "Call our Silovik contacts, get some backing for the new movement."
 Shukshin_unification.3.b:0 "Reach out to the newly formed opposition, we cannot repeat our past mistakes."
 
 Shukshin_unification.4.t:0 "Assurances"
 Shukshin_unification.4.desc:0 "Vladimir Sobolev glanced down at his watch. Mikhail Devyatayev, the Silovik he was due to meet, was of course 5 minutes late. Vladimir thought about finding him and dragging him by his ear into the meeting room when the door opened and in stepped Mikhail.\n\n"Took you long enough" Vladimir muttered to himself as he walked over and shook his hand.\n\n"Sorry. Pokryshkin held me up. He wanted to speak to me about the nature of this meeting" the Silovik explained as he took a seat opposite Sobolev's desk. Vladimir sat down as well.\n\n"It's alright. It was only a few minutes. Now, I was told you were open to the idea of the Federal Assembly"\n\n"I'm open to talking about it" Mikhail reminded the foreign minister.\n\n"Very well. I understand many within your ranks have had... reservations regarding the Federal Assembly. The President is wondering what we could do to alleviate their fears?" Vladimir asked.\n\n"The more moderate members of my organisation want assurances. They see the Federal Assembly as a power grab by Shukshin. Many fear that with the creation of a new government, many will lose their jobs and influence. If you want the Siloviki's help, we want to make sure that we don't lose our power. After all, this Federal Assembly is intended to make the government more efficient, yes?"\n\nSobolev sat back in his chair, thinking over Mikhail's words. The President wouldn't be happy about maintaining the power of the Siloviki in government, after all, the idea was to bring forth democracy, not the status quo.  Vladimir sighed. Like it or not, the Siloviki will be needed if they want the reforms to occur, even if it means compromising on their ideals."
 Shukshin_unification.4.a:0 "I'll see what I can do."
 
 Shukshin_unification.5.t:0 "A Glimmer of the Dream"
 Shukshin_unification.5.desc:0 "The delegates of the three parties sat in near total silence in the chamber. Though it had been hours since the party leadership and a trail of assistants flowed into the room, none had spoken beyond perfunctory responses. Kantorovich and Koryagin, the respective leaders of the democratic socialists and the social liberals, sat across from one another as the former wrote furiously into his notepad and the latter appeared to be mouthing a rehearsal to some speech. Shukshin stayed silent as he eyed each of them with worry. Each knew the importance of the conference, but none were willing to take the first step.\n\nNegotiations over their shared platform were slow and laborious, with none of the three sides willing to come to agreement. Every attempt to compromise only heightened the feeling of how utterly opposed each side was to the views of the next. It was only with the topic of Primakov that the winds of discussion changed.\n\nAs the Siloviki became more and more central to dialogue, so did the will to cooperate. None had to be reminded of the consequences should their opponents succeed, and the feuds among the coalition partners slowly became entirely trivial in comparison. Discourse shifted from how to work around the party's differences into how to use them against their common enemy.\n\nMinute by minute, discussion around the conference room table became nothing short of electric. Party representatives of every side, one by one, began to rise out of their seats feverously as the kindle of enthusiasm became a wildfire. Every representative to the youngest secretary began coordinating policy plans in perfect synergy. Every strategy, every loophole, to gut corporate power and Siloviki control was built upon and expanded until they were flawless and ready to be implemented to their fullest effect - if they could pass the bills to do so.\n\nDiscussion lasted into the smallest hours of the night. As each left the room, an air of change left with them. An alliance of pragmatism had morphed into a sacred pact to protect that which they each held sacred above all else, and with every one of them, to the last, ready to do anything to see it done. Not with colleagues or partners, but fellow keepers of the torch of democracy."
 Shukshin_unification.5.a:0 "So much to be done, with so little time."
 
 Shukshin_unification.6.t:0 "In Pursuit of Peace"
 Shukshin_unification.6.desc:0 "Anatoly Koryagin made a quick correction to his tie as he proceeded up the steps, several pages of documents in hand. As he continued up the curved path to the stage platform he couldn't help but be amazed at the rapid progress his party had made. Just a short few years ago, his political movement was all but banned by Pokryshkin and his thugs, but here he stood ready to bring his party into the limelight with thousands watching from the seats of the party convention.\n\nIt had been a long fought battle to reach this moment. He could still remember his early life under Bukharin's boot, and how he saw it entirely changed when Pasternak first declared the Republic. He had never forgotten the sight of men carrying the Writer's flag as they marched through his homestreet in Kansk. There wasn't a single drop of blood shed in the whole city as it was raised over the capitol building. Of course, times would change, and as the bandits and fools of the Black Army swept through his city in the wake of war, he fled, only a teenager, to Novosibirsk as Central Siberia collapsed around him.\n\nThat contrast between the days of Pasternak and of the Smuta would never leave his mind. War and conflict had needlessly ruined millions of lives, and for nothing. As he worked towards his career in psychiatry, his convictions never subsided. By the time his home city was under the Federation's control, he had already become a leader in the intellectual circles of politics. Slowly, popular support grew in tandem with Shukhin's power and reforms, and now he stood at the precipice of his efforts as he approached the stage podium and began to speak.\n\n''Fellow partymen, I stand before you all as the leader of a struggle. Not for war, or destruction, but a struggle for peace and prosperity, between all nations of the world. With this document I hold in my hand, the Russian Social Liberal Party is officially registered by the Russian Federation, and progress towards a world without calamity can finally commence. Thank you all.''\n\nThe crowd burst into enthusiastic cheers and claps. Koryagin smiled as he looked into the cameras. Feniks was going to explode when they saw the coverage he was getting."
 Shukshin_unification.6.a:0 "The crowd faded from his mind as he waved to the reporters."
 
 Shukshin_unification.7.t:0 "The President's Speech"
 Shukshin_unification.7.desc:0 "President Shukshin stood before a vast crowd of supporters who had gathered from as far as Arkhangelsk to hear Freedom's Champion speak. Shukshin smiled as he approached the microphone, the eyes of the world now upon him.\n\n“Russia is ONE!” the President proclaimed.\n\nImmediately, the crowd erupted in cheers of celebration. It was almost hard to believe it. A people, once so submissive and broken in an age of warlordism, now proud and hopeful of the days ahead. Soon the crowd fell back into silence as the President spoke again.\n\n“But not all Russians are with us this day. Millions of our people beyond our borders still live under occupation. Their rights as human beings stripped from them, reduced to second class citizens in their own land. To those people unfortunate enough to live under such conditions, hear me when I say this”.\n\nShukshin paused for a moment, a smile emerging on his face as he gazed upon the crowds of thousands before him, watching him in silence as was the rest of the world.\n\n“Your liberation is coming!”.\n\nThe crowd cheered wildly as Shukshin look toward the skies, basking in the sunlight and the cool air. He felt it, the winds of change in the afternoon breeze. Things were different now and the world knew it."
 Shukshin_unification.7.a:0 "For the liberation of all Russians!"
 
 Shukshin_unification.8.t:0 "From the Shadows"
 Shukshin_unification.8.desc:0 "Oleg walked down the hallway towards his office. The representative of Magadan had spent today's session in the State Duma arguing against the proposed changes to government made by the RAPP on behalf of Feniks. The debates have been excruciatingly long and the rumours that the President and his clique were hunting down the 'corrupted Siloviki' wasn't doing anything to soothe his troubled mind.\n\nHe approached the door to his office, key in hand when he noticed that it was already opened. Slowly he entered and froze when he saw someone sitting on the desk with a folder in his left hand and a pistol in the other.\n\n"D-Dimitri? What... What are you doing here?" Oleg asked as he closed the door behind him.\n\nDimitri Ivanov stood up and shoved the folder into Oleg's arms.\n\n"Why don't you tell me, representative?" the Monster asked, his tone neutral and his expression unchanging.\n\nSlowly, Oleg opened the folder and saw within it were several documents, receipts and photographs. All evidence of his collaboration with the Feniks corporation. All the bribes he took since the President's inauguration to office. The representative closed the folder and looked the reclusive agent in the eye.\n\n"You're here to arrest me?" Oleg asked.\n\n"Fortunately for you, those aren't my orders but, President Shukshin will no longer tolerate corruption. You are to cut ties with Feniks and any other organisations you have dealings with. If you want to keep your reputation intact, I'd recommend handing in a letter of resignation. Your actions were treasonous. I'd consider this an act of mercy, representative Volkov" Dimitri explained as he put his gun away and walked over to the door.\n\n"Of course, if you mention anything about our meeting here. The President will be the least of your worries."\n\nOleg quietly nodded as Dimitri left the room. He sighed as he set the folder down on his desk and sat down. He was quiet for a moment before reaching for his pen and began writing his resignation letter."

 Shukshin_unification.9.t:0 "Shutting the Door"
 Shukshin_unification.9.desc:0 "As per usual, Vadim had arrived at Krasnoyarsk on time with an envelope in his hands. He stepped up to the door of a large house in the city's outskirts and knocked three times on the door. After a few moments, the door opened and out came Vladimir, the city's representative in the State Duma.\n\n"What the hell are you doing here?!?" Vladimir demanded as he eyed down the young man before him.\n\n"It's Sibir, sir. To be frank, they're not happy with the proposed changes to the government and they want your help to stop that from happening" Vadim explained as he went to hand the envelope to the representative.\n\nVladimir pushed it back.\n\n"Are you guys insane?! I can't be caught with your money. Shukshin's got agents knocking on the doors of every Siloviki with a fucking record. My job's on the line here! I'm sorry but I can't take your money anymore." Vladimir explained, looking over the young man's shoulders.\n\n"What about the proposal to the changes in government?" Vadim asked slowly as he pocketed the envelope.\n\nVladimir sighed. "I have to accept it. My popularity has plummeted in recent weeks, if I say no to this... Sorry, believe it or not, the will of the people actually matters now and I have to go along with it if I want to see my office again next year."\n\nVladimir quickly slammed the door in his face, leaving a very surprised young man standing out in the cold. He sighed as he stepped away from the house, wondering how on Earth was he going to explain this mess to his superiors."
 Shukshin_unification.9.a:0 "Another pawn knocked down."
 
 Shukshin_unification.10.t:0 "The First Step"
 Shukshin_unification.10.desc:0 "Shukshin mumbled to himself, rereading his speech over and over in a monotonous manner. His first speech as the President of the Russian Federation, a glimpse into a new era of democracy for Russia. The weight of the occasion pressed on his shoulders as he walked into the Duma. As he looked upon the country's freely elected officials, from those to his right, to those far to his left, pride in his people, in his country, filled him with energy and newfound confidence.\n\n'I thank to members of the Duma for meeting with me on this day. This is a monumental moment for both the Free World and the Federation. The winds of democracy have breathed life into Russia and her people, and now we must carry the torch that has been handed to us to keep its ideals alive. We shall begin building Russia back up from the anarchy, though this road shall be arduous. The people have no healthcare, they die from common diseases that have been vaccinated decades ago. Our people believe they are defeated by an evil menace. On this, I say that we must bring pride back to our country, to make it a country worth being proud of!'\n\nThose in the Duma looked on with interest. All could agree with these basic ideals, even the radicals in the most right and left wing parties. Shukshin continued towards the more controversial part of his speech.\n\n'But we must also build a country that is truly free, truly democratic, for posterity! It cannot be that this one election is a gasp of democracy in drowning authoritarianism that has ruined our country so. We are only tepidly embracing democracy, while the jackboot of an uncaring oligarchy of corporations holds us in bondage. Of the Siloviki, who once helped build our nation up, who now seek to dominate and control what belongs to the Russian people. This cannot be! We cannot allow our people to languish. If we truly want a nation all can be proud of, it must provide for its people, to educate them, to heal them when they are sick, so that they may love it and sacrifice for it.'\n\nImmediately, the deputies from the RAPP began to clap vociferously and cheer, but the rest of the room was more quiet. Then, the liberal RSLP began to clap respectfully, followed by the left-wing DSPR. Soon, like a fire, the vast majority of the deputies began to clap, and even stand up. Shukshin beamed with pride and hope of a new, pluralistic Russia."
 Shukshin_unification.10.a:0 "Thank you all, your trust will not be misplaced!"
 
 Shukshin_unification.11.t:0 "A Prosperous World"
 Shukshin_unification.11.desc:0 "Was was the liberal ideal? That was a question Anatoly Koryagin was asked often. What made their party different, asked the leftists, from the RAPP, which argued for reforms while holding against broad change? What made them any different from the raving socialists, asked the rightists, from the socialists in the DSPR? Was it simply the temperament of policies? A neat middle ground for professionals and professors who hem and haw at any policy?\n\nNo! It is a liberal ideal, a dream! The liberal dream is that of meritocracy, where all men and women are created equal, where anyone can reach the top, but all are taken care of. It does not hate business, like the socialists, or desire some idealized collective management. Nor does it fetishize hierarchy like the crony capitalists. The liberals see competition and cooperation as linked, creating new comparative advantages that lead to great jumps of innovation!\n\nBut the liberals also believe that all deserve to live, to be able to make that leap into success if they have the guts, the grit, for it! That is a real meritocracy, that is a real democratic society! Where anyone can truly make it. And the Russian Social Liberal Party, the RSLP, was going to build that gentle, yet competitive society to build a new age. Where communism and all kinds of despotism led to ruin, a pluralist and capitalist society would lead to a new age for Russia!"

 Shukshin_unification.12.t:0 "To Honor Labor's Legacy"
 Shukshin_unification.12.desc:0 "Papers and files were thrown across Leonid Kantorovich's crowded desk as he sat alone in his office, hunched over examining a budget proposal. With the newly announced party registry and a formal mandate for his political platform came greater duties for the Right-Narodnik leader by orders of magnitude. The renewed interest in the party alone generated enough paperwork to clutter his workspace as much as his head. Of course, it was a feeling he'd grown accustomed to.\n\nHis first foray into the world of politics felt like lifetimes ago now. The ruling coalition of the Komi Republic was where he first found a place in the public sector, using his background in mathematics to prove himself an important asset to preserving what little economic prosperity  Syktyvkar could. His penchant for the numbers and figures of policy gave him a strong skill set for adapting the ideals of the DSNP to the realities of the Republic.\n\nAs he worked, news from across the Urals was scarce, but that didn't stop tales of the worker's revolt and Narodnik crackdowns from reaching Kantorovich. When the Federation's annexation of the West became clear as an inevitability, he prepared for the worst, but as the last months before the reunification came, so too did change.\n\nPerhaps the President was too amicable to Sibir and too tolerant of the corporate thugs that strangled the country, but Kantorovich admired the cause he fought for. It was Shukshin's policy that brought the Narodniks back from the brink of destruction and away from their backroom, extremist tendencies. In its place stood a true political movement in the DSPR, one that allowed Kantorovich a renewed place in politics he had to pursue.\n\nThere was a code to be cracked in solving the plights of the nation. Burning money away in the pits of corporate greed couldn't be allowed to continue for the people to survive. All it would take is the proper touch and the right solution, and the Federation could be made to work for everyone.\n\nKantorovich continued shuffling through his paperwork. He couldn't allow himself to rest, not while the country so desperately needed the solution to its woes. The Republic had failed. The Narodniks of old had failed. Bukharin had failed. He could not fail Russia again."

 Shukshin_unification.13.t:0 "A Falcon Stripped of Wings"
 Shukshin_unification.13.desc:0 "The modern building of full glass windows which jutted into the sky in central Novosibirsk was unmistakable as the newly founded All-Russian Patriot Party's headquarters. Televisions tuned into local news stations lined the building's walls as Betamax tapes played stock audio of the party's message, "Jobs, Growth, and Country," for any visitors.\n\nBeyond the glossy, front-facing lobby stood several large conference rooms with a central podium surrounded by rows of desks with chairs, filled with the past ministers and leaders of the Siloviki administration. C-Level officers and representatives from Feniks observed the meeting as a party bureaucrat stood ready to speak at the podium.\n\n"The results of our first party congress have returned with a resounding decision. Alexander Pokryshkin, your failure to win election against Vasily Shukshin has threatened the good of the Federation and its leaders beyond acceptability. The body assembled today has voted two to one to elect a new leader to guide this party away from the failures of your administration." Whispers and some gasps filled the room as the Former President stared in disdain. A heavy-set man with reading glasses in his hands stood up and approached the front of the room as Pokryshkin stormed away in disgust and rage. He hastily grabbed the microphone, and addressed the crowd.\n\n"My friends, I thank you for the opportunity to lead this distinguished group of people. I will be brief, the brutal method of controlling the populace which we have used in past days simply will not survive today's changing age. No, something different is needed, an approach which maintains the system that has saved our nation while allowing the people to live and flourish outside our oversight, protected by the soldier, guided by our hand, and safe for the shareholder." Applause filled the room along with the murmurs of a name: Yevgeny Primakov.\n\nPokryshkin marched away from his now former party office. They thought it would be so easy to strip him of his power and influence, the backstabbing bastards, but he was still Vice President and he knew an old friend who would be happy to see such a revered figure at his side and in support of his platform, if perhaps from a more pragmatic position."

His father had been a Red Army soldier who had served under Yegorov during the West Russian War. A full-fledged Communist who perished during the West Russian unification wars. Niko, on the other hand, had grown to idolise Vasily Shukshin, the President of the Russian Federation.\n\nSince the fall of Arkhangelsk, Niko had begun supporting the man who fought for the liberty of all Russians from the forces of tyranny, battling the Siloviki in the halls of the Federal Assembly and challenging the Germans to the west. He would never forget the speech the President had made following the proclamation of the Russian Federation.\n\n“Russia is ONE!” were words the young boy would never forget.\n\nSoon, the song playing on his father's old radio faded away and the announcer began to speak.\n\n“We hoped you have enjoyed another brilliant song from Russia's rising star, Eduard Artemyev. Now, from his home in Novosibirsk, President Shukshin will be giving a speech in regards to a proposed bill that will reform the rights of the Federation's workers for the better” the voice of Radio Arkhangelsk announced.\n\nNiko leaned in closer with a smile on his face as the voice of the President flickered through the speakers."

 Shukshin_unification.20.desc:0 "Mikhail clung to his mother's arm as he examined the city blanketed in the winter snow. Years ago, he would often remain indoors, isolating himself from his home city of Perm beyond the windows of his room. He didn't have any friends; his only company were his parents and his collection of books. The years of anxiety he felt during those years dissipated when the Federation had finally liberated Perm.\n\nToday was a special day. He and his parents had been waiting in a line and the young boy grew increasingly confused with each passing moment. He saw many other adults, all of whom stood in pure excitement over some building. After a few minutes, Mikhail had finally worked up the courage to ask his mother what they were doing here.\n\n"We're going to a cultural festival, it's very important for us. You'll have fun, I promise. There'll be really delicious food and fun music for you to listen to, so cheer up, okay, Misha?" his mother replied.\n\nAfter a few more agonizingly long minutes of waiting in line, they walked into some building named "Perm's Firebird". Inside, countless tables were scattered around, covered in beautiful mantle-cloths, silverware, and porcelain plates. Were they eating at some kind of palace? A nice man took their family to a table, and afterwards, an older man, with greying hair and a triangle-shaped guitar got on the stage.\n\n"For our first song on this fine evening, an old classic, Kalinka!" His parents cheered, along with the rest of the people at the Firebird. The guitar trilled each note, bouncing up and down with a fun jig that Mikhail wanted to get up and dance to! Thinking better of it, he decided to join them in clapping to the beat instead.\n\nEventually, Mikhail looked at a paper-card menu on the table, but frankly, Mikhail couldn't make heads or tails out of these items. "Blini? What's that, ma?" Mikhail's parents looked crestfallen for a moment, before his father spoke up, "It's a food, like a sort of cake. We used to eat it all the time, Misha - before those swastika-lovers showed up."\n\nHis mother held his hand, "Yes, now we can finally live in peace and go outside, Misha. And with the peace around us, your father and I have something very exciting to tell you...""

 Shukshin_unification.21.t:0 "The Missing Piece"
 Shukshin_unification.21.desc:0 "Shushkin sighed as he leafed through the electoral reports from each of the oblasts. Even though they had won by a decent margin, it was still undeniable that both sides had made use of tactics like gerrymandering to gain unfair advantages in certain oblasts. What should have been a rout of the VRPP was instead turned into a sizable but still tenuous victory. Not to mention just how much money the Siloviki had injected into the media.\n\nHis eyes grew tired as his headache worsened, struggling through report after report. The meeting with Pokryshkin and their unwise decision to down many, many bottles left Shushkin rather hungover with a massive headache. A headache only worsened by the twin difficulty of reforming the electoral system when reforms at all were going to be opposed at every step, even by his own party! Once one is in power, they believe they'll never leave. Shukshin feared such an attitude would overtake his own allies.\n\nThe hungover president tucked his hands into the pockets of his coat as he teetered to the window to get some fresh air. It was a nice, if conflicting, view of Barnaul as always. The forests and fields stretched into the horizon on one end with the jungle of concrete and steel on the other.\n\nShushkin cleared his mind and sifted through the stack of letters on his desk before one caught his eye. It was a proposal for a shift towards universal suffrage, a rather bold one considering Russia's traditional society. But tradition had failed Russia one too many times as did radical change. Shushkin pondered and began to draft the beginnings of a bill, one that would cement the a Russia where all would be given equal say."

 Shukshin_unification.24.desc:0 "The breeze that blew across Mount Alkhanai was a warm wind, making it the perfect temperature to go walking around. Buyan would have preferred these days a year ago, because it would have meant walking to Naro Hazhod with the birds chirping among the trees below, before a long meditation in which he could become at peace with this chaotic world. After the whole site had become a national park, however, warm weather meant tourists flocking to get a look at customs they had no understanding of.\n\n'This here…' Buyan explained to a group of about twenty he had led up the stone path, 'is the Temple Gate, leading towards the Naro Hazhod.' He gestured to a rock formation which formed a rough circle through which pilgrims would pass. 'When you pass through, you enter the world of the guardian deity Alkhanov Demchog, a place of healing and contemplation.' Buyan carefully moved his hands behind his back after finishing his explanation, returning his focus back to the tourists. 'Any questions?' Most of them were barely paying attention to him. They had their cameras out, taking pictures of the gate as well as the shrine which lay beyond. Some had snacks that they had brought with them. Across the gate there was a man currently walking in a circle around the shrine, which some in the group were giggling at the sight of. Buyan's heart thumped with anger, seeing this group treating their sacred traditions as one might a carnival. There was nothing he could do, though. He had chosen to work for the national park to try and keep their traditions respected, and he would do his best to make sure that happened.\n\n'Please, make sure to treat this area with respect and reverence,' Buyan explained even as he only had half of the group's attention. 'This land is a sacred site, one that many pilgrims visit throughout the year. Now, please, feel free to explore the grounds but be sure not to disturb any who are taking part in rituals throughout this area.'\n\nThe group was eager to look at more of the temple, most of them heading through the gate without a second's thought. Buyan watched as one man dropped the wrapper for a bag of nuts onto the stone below, completely ignoring the 'No Litter' sign right beside him."

 Shukshin_unification.25.desc:0 "The sun shined through the skylights of the conference room where the Federation's governing coalition gathered to meet, just as they had so many days ago. Smiles and warm handshakes filled the room in a striking contrast to the awkwardness of past days. Shukshin gave a warm welcome to his comrades in arms, grinning as he welcomed Koryagin and Kantorovich, though the pair were less enthused to see each other. The many representatives of each party had come to know each other with a great familiarity, even on a first name basis, as party divides became little but a formality.\n\nThe lax nature of the conference only became more apparent as RSLP officials brought out a glass of champagne. Many, especially of the DSPR, protested but soon all in the room conceded to a toast. The coalition had undeniably won many great victories. In such a short period, the Silovik oppression of years, decades, had already begun to fade. Suffrage had been entirely revolutionized, healthcare was at a quality never before seen in Russia's entire history, and the Federation's workers and land had finally begun to heal from the scars inflicted by the megacorporations. So many in the room didn't believe they'd ever get this far, let alone so quickly.\n\nAs the cheers and celebrations dragged on, they slowly died out as discussing matters of governance replaced them. 'Our triumph cannot be understated of course, but Primakov and his goons continue to undermine us at every turn.' Agreeing mumbles and whispers filled the room with the remark from Koryagin. 'We may have won the battle, but the war continues.'\n\n'And what do you propose? Alienating what Silovik allies exist in the Duma would only make our struggles greater,' Shukshin replied.\n\n'No, no, the issue is not the Siloviki,' Kantorovich was met with surprise and raised eyebrows. 'They wouldn't bother to hamper our legislation if it weren't for the 'donations' rolling in from Feniks. We cannot work around corporate power and impede what it can influence. No, if we are to triumph over their greed, it must be attacked directly.'\n\nSilence fell over the hall. 'Walk us through this,' Shukshin said as secretaries began to dictate."

There were only two things he cared for in the world: his office as Chief of Police of Tomsk, and his obsession with the RAPP's 'wrongdoings'. So it was tonight, as every night.\n\nColonel Dmitri Mikhailov, a frequent guest in Tatiana's home, was already teetering on the edge of drunkenness. ' - And now, they're auditing my dacha. Misappropriation of funds my ass!' The older man's second chin spilled across his chest as he tapped his cigar into an ashtray. 'It's never been a problem before! And, what, the RAPP's people never had to withdraw a little extra to maintain their mission readiness? Never lost a signature on an authorization? Those hypocrites-'\n\nTatiana's husband cut him off with a raised hand. 'No need to burst a vein, my friend. Enjoy a bite to eat-' Konstantin motioned for his wife to place the tray on the closest table. Yet, he never broke eye contact with his friend. '- And I'll have Tatiana whip us up some dessert. And don't worry about this investigation. I'll talk to my friends in the Records Department. Whatever you need to keep Shukshin's boys off your back, you'll have it.' He smiled. 'Dear, why don't you start on a pie for Dimka? We have a bit of elderberry left, no?' Konstantin waved her away, not waiting for her reply.\n\nTatiana swallowed the lump in her throat, nodded, and left the drawing room. But as she re-entered her kitchen, manicured nails already lighting the gas in the stove, she noticed something out of the corner of her eye. The phone, already slightly yellowed, sat in its mount just above her favorite cutting board. And so, as she floured the board and began to conjure a pie crust from nothing, she squeezed the receiver between her shoulder and ear, and made a call."

Was there anything you needed before I finished my shift?" the young secretary asked.\n\n"No, it's fine Svetlana" Vasily replied as he looked up from his mess of a desk and at the young woman. She seemed quite anxious.\n\n"Is everything alright?" Vasily asked.\n\n"Oh, I'm fine, Mr President. Just looking forward to tonight. My partner and I are going out tonight to watch a movie from America! Planet of the Apes I think it's called.

Please, try to get some sleep, Vasily. Everyone is getting worried about your health. Alexander and Amet are constantly asking me about it".\n\nVasily was silent as she left his office. The President looked down at his paperwork but only stared at it for a few moments before sighing and turning away. He looked out the window and saw his secretary run into the arms of her partner, Peter. The writer smiled for a moment before looking back at his office.

God, how it burned! But it burned like Novosibirsk- energetic and warm, hateful and loving and proud, alive and forcing you to live with it. It was the kind of drink, and the kind of city, that made you change with it.\n\nPokryshkin knocked on the door to the balcony, and slipped outside. "What's on your mind?"\n\nShukshin smiled at his old friend. "The world beyond Russia." He leaned back on the balcony's glass railing. "We can't just nosedive into the Nazi horde. Russia needs allies, people we can trust, trade with, live with."\n\nAlexander shook his head. "Allies are one thing. But I've often thought of... a sphere." He took a sip of his own vodka. "An area we can trade with, yes. But one that follows our lead. That looks to us as leaders. Not the Americans, not the Japanese. Us. Our own OFN."\n\n"In a sense, yes." Shukshin sighed, looking down at his glass. "There's no doubt the world is changing. When we retake Moscow, will we still be useful to Washington? Will Tokyo still allow us to compete with them in a fair market? Will they allow our people to prosper? These thoughts have been on my mind."\n\nPokryshkin clapped the President on the shoulder. "I'm in agreement, old friend. You are not the only one in Russia to realize this fact. Hell, everyone except the pacifists realize that the globe is like a market- only the strong survive, get rich, live to fight another day. There can only be one apex predator in an economy."

Recently, these tensions erupted into a full-scale civil war, forcing our hand as a continuously increasing influx of refugees masses at our borders.\n\nThe nascent Kazakh Defense Force is led by Sagadat Nurmangabetov, a Soviet soldier turned Kazakh nationalist with broad support amongst his people. Preliminary reports indicate that Nurmangabetov is open to negotiating with the Russian Federation so long as the self-determination of the Kazakh people is acknowledged and respected. Opposing him are the remnants of the Soviet Republic, led by Mikhail Solomentsev, a hardline communist and pro-Russian statesman. It is the Ministry's firm belief that a Soviet victory, whilst beneficial for the Russian minority, would not just threaten the stability of the Federation but all of Central Asia, harming our reconstructive and peacekeeping efforts within the region.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nThe Ministry of Defense strongly recommends that swift, decisive military and civilian aid be sent to the in order to secure Russian interests in the region. Once Nurmangabetov and his forces have prevailed, we will leverage our foreign aid into negotiating a favorable settlement, bringing the Federation's ideals to Kazakhstan whilst still ensuring that Nurmangabetov's desire for an independent Kazakhstan is not encroached upon."

Recently, these tensions erupted into a full-scale civil war, forcing our hand as a continuously increasing influx of refugees masses at our borders.\n\nThe remnants of the Soviet Republic, currently organized under the 'Organization for the Preservation of the Soviet Union,' are led by Nikolai Shchelokov, who, despite his Soviet loyalty, has been discovered to be somewhat blasé regarding his ideological loyalties and is suspected to be willing to negotiate with just about any form of non-fascistic government. Opposing him is the Kazakh Socialist Republic, led by a mixture of Kazakh nationalists and communists. It is the Ministry's firm belief that a Kazakh victory would threaten not just the stability of the Federation but her continued interests in the Central Asian region.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nThe Ministry of Defense strongly recommends swift, decisive military and civilian aid be sent to secure Russian interests in the region. Once Shchelokov and his forces have prevailed, we can leverage such support to establish and consolidate total control over the Central Asian region. The most likely outcome projects a complete annexation of Kazakhstan into the Federation.

Due to the ongoing civil war, resistance to armed intervention is expected to be minimal.

 Shukshin_foreignpolicy.5.desc:0 "MINISTRY OF DEFENSE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION\nPUBLISHED: [GetDateText]\n\nBRIEF:\nFollowing the collapse of the Soviet Union, Kazakhstan, officially the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, remained de-facto independent under the chairmanship of Dinmukhamed Kunaev. Internal struggles following the ascension of NKVD Chief Pavel Fitin to power greatly exacerbated Russo-Kazakh ethnic tensions, and following Fitin's death, these tensions boiled over into an armed conflict between Kazakh forces under Sagadat Nurmagambetov and Russian forces led by Mikhail Solomentsev, with the former successfully crushing the latter and establishing the Republic of Kazakhstan.\n\nThis new regime has faced many issues in its first few years of rule. Banditry, famine, and an increasingly-rebellious Russian minority all plague the Republic of Kazakhstan. For now, Nurmagambetov holds absolute power among his people, enjoying a cult-like following due to his status as a Kazakh war hero. Major urban centers such Almaty or Kyzylorda lie wrecked with crime and poverty, while the northern countryside remains a haven for anti-government militias and bands to gather and strike. The Kazakh military has been unable to effectively crush these forces, relying on outdated equipment and tactics to secure its lands effectively.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nMilitary intervention has been deemed unnecessary, with the Kazakh government posing no threat to the Federation at this moment. While an intervention would certainly liberate the oppressed Russians living in Kazakhstan's northern regions, our planners have projected a protracted guerrilla war against pro-Kazakh forces should we intervene. Moreover, while Nurmagambetov and his anti-Russian rhetoric does alienate our nation diplomatically, overtures of a potential 'defensive pact' shouldn't be ruled out at this stage, provided Nurmagambetov accepts the presence of Russian peacekeeping forces within the Kazakh Republic."

With the removal of long-time Communist Party Chairman Dinmukhamed Kunaev from power, a full-scale civil war has erupted between the clashing ethnic groups in the country. It seems the native Kazakh faction has emerged victorious in this conflict, announcing the creation of a true "Kazakh Socialist Republic" to stand perpetually against Russian 'aggression.'\n\nCurrently, the leader of the Republic is First Secretary Zhumabek Tashanev, a hardline communist and Kazakh nationalist.

Although Kunaev held nominal power, the party was divided, mainly due to ethnic tension between the Russians of Northern Kazakhstan and the southern Kazakh majority. The internal party division allowed the forces of the Russian Guard, an ethnic Russian federation of militias led by Nikolai Shchelokov, to incite a rebellion in Northern Kazakhstan against the newly picked ethnically Kazakh Chairman Zhumabek Tashenev, whose forces eventually surrendered as Shchelokov cemented his position over the steppes of Kazakhstan, establishing the Alma-Ata Autonomous Zone.\n\nNikolai Shchelokov's governance is peculiar, evoking a mixture of Soviet nostalgia and Russian nationalism. This culture is ingrained in key state institutions and is present in the name of the ruling political party (Organization for the Preservation of the USSR). There is a widespread cult of personality around Shchelokov, especially among the Russian populace, who view him as a charismatic strongman. Despite the state's invocation of Soviet ideals, Schelokov's policies run counter to that of the USSR, as he and the Russian Guard seem uninterested in following the principles of Marxism, as our intelligence states that close advisors to Schelokov believe he is disinterested in running the state as a proper nation and is willing to submit to any pragmatic or neutral Russian government.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nEntering negotiations into the statelet is our best option, as Schelokov already seems interested in joining the Federation proper.

It had experienced the red rush of revolution and the horrors of occupation. From a warlord state to the frontline of Russia, Kostroma braced itself for the task ahead.\n\nSergei Bolshakov stood at the steps of city hall, observing thousands of people cheering on columns of soldiers from the Kostroma 'Divine' riflemen brigade. Once, he had been a toppled warlord. Now he stood as the legally elected mayor of Kostroma, side by side with his friend Nikifor. As they watched, the sons of Russia marched proudly through the streets of their native city, each step taking them closer and closer to the Third Reich's frontier.\n\n“You know, it seems like just yesterday we would have done anything to stay at peace. Now we're cheering as we send our boys back into the meat grinder. How can you support this, Sergei?” his security minister had to ask..\n\n"Have a little faith in the cause,” Sergei said. “Our sons aren't marching to die. They're on the frontlines to fight for freedom. How can you expect them to fight such a battle if we can't show them our most sincere gratitude? They are prepared to make an immense sacrifice. How do you expect them to have the will to face this great challenge without their family's support?”\n\nBolshakov turned to gaze at the flag bearers in front of the closest company. One held a tiny flag of Kostroma- but before him, the strongest soldier of the company bore the tri-color of the Federation high into the air. Wind caught and tore at the flag, threatening to throw it from its perch, but the thin fabric held.\n\n“I get that. But Sergei, with everything that's happened since the fall of the old Union, Russia is not as strong as it once was,” Nikiifor explained, attempting to get his point across.\n\n"You're right,” the mayor of Kostroma spoke, a wide smile on his face as he turned to face his old friend. “We aren't as strong as we once were.”"

How can we claim to be freeing the people of Moscow without offering them a path to freedom, a comprehensive social strategy, and a plan to build socialism?”\n\n“Very well,” Sidorov said.\n\n“Let's take a vote. How many of you consider Bukharin a revisionist?” A third of the assembled raised their hands.“And how many consider yourselves Bukharinisty?” Sidorov asked. One hundred and fifty of the assembled men and women raised their hands. “How many of you consider yourselves anarchists?” Eighty hands flew into the air. “How many Trotskyists?” Fifty hands. “How many Stalinists?” Forty-four. “How many Luxembourgists?” Thirty-three, and one that had a question. “How many Maoists?” Seventy-six. “How many Syndicalists?” Twenty-two, nearly all of them Anarchists as well. “And how many,” Sidorov said, “want to see those god-damned fascists out of our country?” Every hand in the forest stood tall, like a monument, offering unity and support to their comrades in arms.\n\n“Thank you, comrades. On the basis of democratic centralism, this Congress' first item of business will be to effect the destruction of the Nazi armed forces in the area, with the long term goal of reclamation of the heartland of the proletarian revolution.

Quickly raising his rifle, Nikolai put another German flat on his back with a sharp crack. “Kolya!” the Major howled from up ahead, “The fucking Kamchatkans will be in Moscow before you! Move your arse!” Rolling towards them, Nikolai saw yet another groaning row of panzers, infantrymen crawling in their furious shadows like ants. Nikolai's gut flipped and squealed as they approached, but he didn't have the time to retch. His unit had dropped flat on their stomachs as the anti-tank squad loaded their arms. As he stumbled forward, a hand reached up and seized Nikolai's arm, pulling him to the ground. “Kolya,” his friend hissed, “Keep down. Can't you see the Germans?”\n\n“Misha, I-- "\n\nNikolai was interrupted by the sudden thunder of a tank beside him, that seemed to burst out of the ground itself. Nikolai screamed and rolled over, fumbling uselessly with his rifle. It was only when he saw the two-headed eagle painted on the side and heard Misha laughing that he realised it was one of theirs. “Up, lads!” Major Chernyshev leapt to his feet, as Russian tanks barrelled down on either side of him, “Let's kill some krauts! Forward!” With his blood running so hot it felt like fire, Nikolai ran and screamed with his comrades.\n\n“Ura!” “Ura!” “Ura!”\n\nAbove him, he suddenly felt the rippling scream of jet fighters above him, as Russian falcons darted in between the rumbling flock of German bombers. Rows of tanks crashed into one another like a wave, smoke and flames leaping from their turrets. As the German ants began appearing from behind the hulking panzers, a storm of Russian gunfire was unleashed. Everything faded from Nikolai's mind, and all that he could focus on was making sure his next step was not his last. The battle could have raged for an hour or an eternity. Nikolai didn't know."

He had seen plenty of conflict in his time, having fought in unification wars, fighting off raiders but this war... this war was different.\n\nThe destruction.\nThe brutality.\nThe anger.\n\nGeorgy looked at the bodies that had surrounded him. Some were soldiers, most civilians. Some were Germans, some were Russians. It was death all the same. The soldier's eyes squeezed tight, his fist balling in anger as he tried to suppress the terrifying images of the many sins he had committed throughout this long war. German soldiers on the floor, begging for their lives. Settlers fleeing their homes, trying to escape the destruction. Entire towns full of Germans set ablaze. In his mission to liberate his people from the tyranny of Germany, he had become the very monster he once thought the Germans were.\n\nWas the President telling them the truth? Is this conflict as black and white as he had been told or were the Germans and Russians not so different from one another? Was the President nothing more than a wolf in sheep's clothing? No, no... he couldn't be, right?\n\nAt that very moment, Georgy fell to his knees. He was angry at the people who orchestrated this war. He hated the Nazi party for manipulated the people of Germany to hate. He was furious at his government, which had sent them back into the fray. This wasn't liberation. This is war. Where the young and stupid are tricked by the old and bitter into killing each other!\n\nGeorgy sighed as his hands soften once more. The ones up top may have caused this but it was he who was the fool. He had been stupid, angry and he allowed them to weaponise his flaws and send him into battle. He had been convinced by Shukshin he was fighting for freedom, yet he was surrounded by ruins and fallen souls.\n\nIt was too late to be angry now. All that remains for him in this world is sorrow."

The people didn't seem to care that there was a war still raging, the fate of Europe hanging in the balance. After decades of oppression, they were just happy to finally be free of all the pain they have endured for years. They won't have to endure slavery and fear persecution. For once in their lives, they were finally free.\n\nGrowing up in the forests of Siberia, under the rule of the Siberian Black Army, Bodgan had never truly known oppression himself. He had always been, for the most part, free from the rule of governments. Even when the Federation under Pokryshkin had taken control of Kansk, his family was left alone. To see be drafted to fight by the All-Russian Army, to march Westward with his fellow Russians just to see how bad things really were. To see a land without freedom, subjugated by a genocidal regime. It made Bodgan sick to his stomach.\n\nBodgan had been thinking of his father during his time in Moscow. He wondered if his father would have been proud of him? For leaving his home and answering the call to free Russia from the rule of Germany. Bogdan sighed as the thought of his mother faded into his mind. He couldn't imagine what she must be feeling now. Terrified for her son, fighting an enemy that wants the dream of Russia to die. To crush Shukshin's vision beneath their boots.\n\nOn the streets, he saw two kids. They were quiet at first, testing the boundaries of what they could do. More and more, they began playing simple games and only became more enthusiastic when nobody tried to stop them. They began laughing, jumping around as they played on the streets. The children, like millions of others across the front, were at last, experiencing true freedom. Something they would learn to cherish for the rest of their lives.\n\nIt was all worth the struggle, Bodgan had decided as a smile began to form on his face."

The U of N's newest host was none other than former president Alexander Pokryshkin. All around the bar, the usually noisy and lively bar was well-contained and quiet as they listened to the students and the former strongman.\n\n"Mister Pokryshkin," a young woman spoke in crackled tones through the radio, "Your presidency is highly criticized despite the fact that during the election, you spoke consistently of how you united Russia during the Smuta. Do you still believe in your words from back then? Were the Siloviki, and your cooperation with them, the reason Russia was reunited?"\n\nThere was a moment of silence, punctuated by an older man's grunt, until he responded more clearly. "It is true that the capitalist government we ran in Novosibirsk, with the aid of the Siloviki, was uniquely able to bring investment and modernization to our people, I stand by that." The bartender sighed before Pokryshkin's distorted voice came through again, "But there's a difference between a capitalist democracy, and a capitalist plutocracy. Capitalism is good, but when it stops democracy, when it stops the ability to check its own excesses, that can cause problems."\n\n"So," the woman spoke again, "you sound a lot like President Shukshin, would you say you agree with him? Would you join the RAPP?"\n\nPokryshkin laughed, "No, I would not join the RAPP. But I do think Shukshin made some good arguments that have proven true. However, I will warn you all, while democracy is well and good, we cannot go as far as to support communism, or even this 'democratic socialism'. That will destroy our economy, and kill jobs.

His train of thought was interrupted by his former rival - now once again a close ally, Alexander Pokryshkin, shuffling into his stuffy office with a bottle of vodka. Cheerfully, he said, 'Care for a drink, Vasily?'\n\nAs Pokryshkin poured each of them a tall shot of vodka, Shukshin once more peered out of the window into the stormy afternoon, idly jotting some note down.

Thus came forth the womb that would bear the fruit of Russian ingenuity. A great slab of concrete was poured and sheltered from the rain, as any father would shelter their only daughter. At midnight upon the seventh day of the month, as the concrete lay drying, a lone soul crept into the poorly secured building site. Frydrik Myuler, the last scion of Velimir the Great, offered a prayer to Perun and pressed his severed finger into the drying concrete. A sacrifice, for the strength of the Russian people.\n\nThen came the bones. Great beams of steel, carved from the flesh of mountains, laid down upon a plain swept by tools of men. A month passed, and the spirit of the great monument was outlined by its fathers. Two months, and the beast took shape. Three, and the bones knit together into a skeleton. Again, Myuler snuck into the launch site, and painted a sacrifice of his own blood upon the holy girders. A sacrifice, for the hope of all Russians.\n\nNext came forth the beast's veins. Pipes, imported from factories in Samara, entwined with a septic heart. Great ducts of flimsy aluminum, clumsily pressed together, formed the titan's lungs. Wires laid down in Amur crossed the vastness of Russia to become a nervous system. By now, the government had erected security fences around the half-born creation. Myuler dug under the fences, entered the facility, and smeared his breath, his phlegm, and his bile upon the naked electrical system. A sacrifice, that Russian should be spoken in the heavens.\n\nFinally, the labor was complete. A skin of fiberglass and brick stretched over the beast, covering its blessed organs and completing the facade of normalcy. Yuri, as Frydrik was known to his work team, stood silently as an Orthodox priest cried false blessings over the Barnaul Space Center.

 RAPP.11.desc:0 "The sun shined brightly through the window of Colonel General Matyev Popov's office, cutting its way through the thick smoke from his cigar. He glanced over design plans for the new rocket propulsion system the engineers had designed. Supposedly, this was going to send a Russian to space. Matyev grunted disapprovingly, moving to tap the end of his cigar against his ashtray. Any rocket strong enough to send a Russian into space ought to be pointed at their enemies, not the stars. But President Shukshin had ordered that he ensure the rocket's viability, and he was never one to disobey a presidential order.\n\nThe Colonel General heard a knock on the door. The engineer who had designed this damned engine finally arrived! "Come in, come in!" Matyev yelled towards his doors as he waved his cigar at them as if that would somehow quicken the process of opening. Vladimir Kopylov entered, a short fellow with a mustache that looked like a rat's tail. "Sit, boy, sit." The Colonel General sat forward against his desk causing the medals on his chest to jingle against one another. "This engine… tell me about it."\n\n"Well, sir," Vladimir began as he sat opposite Matyev, "it is similar to the rockets that the Germans used to send their man to the moon. We've been going over designs of the rockets that they used during the Second Patriotic War." He took out a pen from his breast pocket and circled parts of the diagram on the desk. "We've made great strides in understanding how they were able to store liquid oxygen in great enough quantities to produce the combustion necessary to lift a rocket into orbit, and make maneuvers while there. That's what this engine is. It's powerful enough to get a man into orbit, and bring him down just where we need him."\n\nA rocket that was able to change its trajectory while in orbit? Matyev's mind raced with the possibilities. With this, Russia would be able to strike anywhere on the globe. No nation would threaten her security, as they all could be hit with a Russian rocket at any moment. And if the engineer's comments on its precision were accurate, they would be able to strike military targets without even having to send a man into the country. Perhaps President Shukshin was on to something with this space program.\n\n"

No, beyond fucked- despite all the work they'd put in, half the frequencies were useless, and the other half nearly so. And no one had any idea which part of the equipment was at fault-\n\nBoop! The console in front of him rang. A white light flashed, but there was no response from the intercom. Lavro leaned over the microphone.'Rykov, can you hear me?' Boop! The light flashed again. The response came, but not in the correct form. Rykov was receiving, but Lavro couldn't hear his response! The engineer rubbed his weary eyes. 'How?

Go back to the previous frequency.'\n\nBoop!'This is Rykov, cen-al do-u co-'\n\nLavro slammed his hand into the intercom button. 'Rykov, the blasted thing is all static now. I give up. Go back to the start of our routine. We need a stable frequency.' He fiddled with the tuning dial, muttering to himself. 'I should've been a damn rocket scientist. Wouldn't be stuck here threading a frequency needle, management breathing down my neck...' He found the original frequency.\n\nBoop! 'This is Rykov. Lavro, you don't think they're going to fire us over this?'\n\n'Others would suffer for us instead, friend.' The engineer chuckled through clenched teeth. 'I suspect the antenna. We should send it back to R&D instead of constantly trying for band-aids. Easier like that.'\n\nRykov sighed on the other end of the radio. 'I suppose it'll just be another set of numbers to add to the pile. Can't wait to explain this to the suits. Honestly, I'm ready for this to be over with already.'\n\n'Listen, I'm frustrated too.'

Both politicians had been stuck in the gridlock of personal debate for over an hour. It was getting ridiculous. To think, that such a petty request had run aground, that such time had been wasted when other work needed to be done. Slowly but surely, Shukshin's patience was running dry. Slowly but surely, the sand of frustration had begun to fill his cup. Vasily took a sip. He'd forgotten to add sugar.\n\nRepresentative Koltosov was still pacing. 'The poverty statistics in the Caucasus are overwhelming. Shouldn't we divert taxpayer money to help our Federation's allies? This space program was way over budgeted from the start. And now you're coming to us, hat in hand, asking for even more funds. What is this madness even for? We govern the largest country on the planet, with riches to fill our bellies for the next century and space to settle people in. How will visiting the moon help the common man?'\n\n'Because we need to make our dreams into reality, my friend. It is why we were elected and it's what will maintain our voters. Without it, we can't enact agrarian reform, nor can we leash the corporations. It will be a message to the people and world as well.

'The party decided. You decided. I, and those I represent, did not decide.' He ceased his pacing, just at the threshold of the door. 'If I wasn't in this party right from when we were huddled in Barnaul, I'd walk. And so would the others in my bloc. But we've come too far.' He shook his head in disappointment.

The Americans liked to think of themselves as the most civilized people on Earth, but they were no better than the rest. Their capital was built to evoke the Roman Republic, and that seemed fitting. The American government was nearly as corrupt as the ancient Republic had been. The silver lining to being in this decrepit swamp was that Amet-khan could use this corruption to his own advantage.\n\nHis eyes moved towards the door as a gaunt figure sauntered his way in. According to Amet-khan's file, his name was Curtis Reed. A Russian agent had made initial contact, but it was up to Amet-khan to seal the deal. Curtis wore a suit which looked hastily put on, with a tie loose around his neck. From the way the man adjusted it as he scanned the room, Amet-khan knew it was loose from fidgeting. Not ideal, dealing with a man with an anxious temperament. Still, money talked. Amet-khan caught the man's eye, and the American began to make his way over.\n\n'I don't think anyone followed me.' Curtis spoke low once he was near the table. He sat down and clasped his hands between his knees, sweat visibly running down his temple. He was probably saying that as much for his sake as Amet-khan's. Amateur.\n\nAmet-khan began by sweet talking the disgruntled worker, 'So… NASA's funding gets cut after the Germans land on the moon. Funding cuts mean pay cuts, so you don't get paid what you deserve.' Then, he moved in for the kill. 'Listen, I can offer you double your salary if you manage to get blueprints on NASA's rocket systems. One fifth now, the rest upon delivery. How's that sound to you?'\n\nHe saw Curtis nod almost immediately. Not surprising, he thought. He had a wife and three children according to their records, and while he wasn't poor, they must be struggling to live their old lifestyle. Amet-khan reached down to take hold of a suitcase, moving it across the table to Curtis. 'Take it,' he said, 'and deliver the blueprints here by 8 tonight. Don't be late.'"

As he spoke, dozens of Russian scientists, businessmen, and officers stared with determined focus.\n\n'Specifically, this is a Four-Phase Systems Al1 8-bit slice chip. Designed in 1969 by Lee Boysel. By March of 1973, this chip was incorporated into three hundred and seventy-four major industrial sites throughout America, for the simple fact that it runs faster than a horse on steroids. By November of 1973, the design was purchased by the Department of Defense, and Four-Phase Systems was locked into a permanent, exclusive contract. By January of '74 the chip design was leaked to Reich spies. In May of the same year, the German government hired myself and three other Swedes to study how microprocessor technology could be incorporated into future Reich aerospace endeavors, including a potential mission to Mars,' he said.\n\nHe smiled, and locked eyes with the nearest guard. 'Considering how the war went, I don't think they'll be heading into space anytime soon.' Anward turned back to his audience, chuckling at his own joke.\n\n'I've been led to understand that the Federation currently operates its computer systems primarily through integrated circuit technology,' he said. 'A microprocessor belongs to the integrated circuit family in the same way that Homo Sapiens belongs to the Hominid family. My team anticipates that fully integrating microprocessor technology into your current electronic information systems will result in a forty to forty-five percent efficiency increase in the conduct of Operation: Zorya. You see- Ah, yes, the gentleman in the back?'\n\nA heavyset, bearded man in horned-rimmed glasses lowered his hand. 'Yes, this is fascinating, thank you.

In the very center of the gaggle was Dmitry Morozov of the All-Russian Central Broadcasting Group- recently renamed from Sibir Central Broadcasting, Incorporated. A known conservative, nationalist, and patriot. Counterbalancing Morozov was Ekaterina Balabanov, a bilingual leftist from the Moscow Herald. Beyond the two Russians were ink-wasters of every nation; two Americans from the San Francisco Times, representatives of the Asahi and Sankei Shimbun, a senior editor of the Press and Journal, and even a cohort from O Globo.\n\nFor Nikitin, it was heaven.\n\n'Our nascent space program has been extraordinarily successful,' Nikitin said. 'We project that the initial stage of development and infrastructure production will be completed two months before schedule.' Behind him, a fifty-meter deep pool shimmered with danger and azure beauty.\n\n'Our intention is to advance both German and American designs through collaboration with former members of both programs. Did you know, the senior-most member of the German space suit design team defected to the Federation? Turns out his wife was Polish,' he said. The gaggle of journalists furiously scribbled down every detail. The Polish angle- that was a story they could run with.\n\n'Today, we're testing two things. Number one, the integrity and agility of the latest space suit models. Number two, the performance of the team members under conditions comparable to microgravity,' he said. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a handheld radio. 'Gentlemen, please begin the test.'\n\nOn the far side of the enormous pool, eight besuited men and women dove into the crystal depths. Only a single cable, one for each, kept them from falling forever to the bottom of the artificial sea.\n\n'This is Mission Leader Zaytsev,' the radio crackled. 'Beginning our descent at time 14:23.'\n\nNikitin smiled as the journalists leaned towards the radio, straining to hear Zaytsev's speech.\n\n'Proceeding normally... all is well. Wait, scratch that,' Zaytsev said.\n\nMission Leader, confirm the problem,' General Popov said hurriedly over the radio.\n\n'Sir, Valentina's suit just sprung a leak at the left shoulder joint.

The top fin of the space shuttle bore the Federation's flag, bold stripes of newborn white, deepsea blue, and sunset red. The carapace itself was stark, unmarred, every inch stronger than the bones of a building. She was immortal, unstoppable, some manner of spirit or goddess they'd conjured up to bear their nation to the moon, not a machine. Not any sort of creation of man.\n\nVasily reached, trembling, and lay his hand on the shuttle's wing. 'This is everything I'd hoped for,' he said.

The Ironworks would be suckled by hundreds of strong Russian men, giving of themselves for their country and for the beast. And every thrust, every strain of muscles, every burn and every drip of sweat was by his will.\n\nHe saw the industry, and behold, it was good."

 NOV_flavor.5.desc:0 "The streets of Zlatoust are slick with tears. The brackish air stinks of exhaustion, and dread. Not the terror of a bullet wound, or a throbbing sore, but the deep, pounding certainty of a miserable future. The city's children remember when Yevgeny Dragunov broke free of the Stalinists, and promised them a future of prosperity and freedom. They hoped, and prayed, and fought for that future. Like Daedalus the inventor, they escaped the horrors of the Anarchy by strength of arms and strength of mind, building a utopia in the midst of agony and apocalypse.\n\nBut Zlatoust was conquered. By pen and by bullet, her dream was slaughtered. Her people lost their homes, their freedom. They lost everything. And unto the wreckage of a dream deferred loped the three jackals: Sibir, Feniks, and Titan. The corporate behemoths crushed the city between diamond molars, tossing good men and women out of their homes and turning owners into employees. Entrepreneurs and businessmen devolved into sales clerks, or cashiers, or beggars.\n\nThe dream of a free Zlatoust is dead. But the people remain - and the people must be protected. When President Shukshin called for new parties to be formed, parties that would counter the domination of the Mega-Corporations, Alexei Novikoff answered.  “But I can't do it alone,” Alexei said to the enraptured crowd. “Zlatoust needs a voice. We are more than an appendage of Novosibirsk. We are not a dumping ground for corporate products. Our mother city is ancient and venerable, opulent and proud, and she deserves to be heard at the Federal level,” he said.\n\nAlexei slammed his fist into the podium. “My opponent, Mr. Nobokov, is nothing but a tool of Feniks Corporation. Those parasites! They'll buy up every factory and every business in this city until they own everything. How many folks in the audience are small business owners?” Nearly a quarter of the room raised their hand. Only three of them were plants. “Feniks, and Nobokov, want to steal your property out from under you. They want to own you. They want to own your family. Are we going to let those sons of bitches enslave our city?\n\nThe crowd thundered as one."

His suit was too tight in the waist, and when he sat the pants legs sat perhaps a quarter inch too high on his legs. There was no question- Alexei would have to hire a tailor. Zlatousti, of course.\n\n“The Cozze del Belgio,” his dining companion said, “is disastrous. Good Belgian chocolate is so hard to find these days. To think, that idiot is wasting it on a chocolate covered mussel.” The old man shook his head.\n\nAlexei glanced at the menu. What kind of restaurant only serves mussels? “Well, what do you recommend?” he asked.\n\n“Nothing. I've eaten at Mollusca eight times now. Five dinners, two lunches, and one takeout to the regional office. The food is crap, the service is mediocre, and the wine is overcosted.” The old man extended his hand across the table. "But the CMO's son in law owns the place. I'm Anatoly Yahontov, Chief Financial Officer of Titan Group.”\n\n“Thank you, Mister Yahontov. I've brought a list of policies and proposals we should discuss. At your convenience, of course,” Alexei said. “Our data shows these laws will improve productivity in the Ural region by fifteen -”\n\nYahontov cut him off with a wave of a hand. “I don't care.” He leaned back and stretched, nearly knocking a tray of mussels out of a waitress's hands. “ Mister Novikoff, we don't care about your policies. We need relationships in the Duma. Give me a reason why Titan should back you.” He took a sip of his pearl white wine. “What can you do for us?”\n\n“My campaign is based on returning prosperity and freedom to Western Siberia. I support patriotic, pro-business policies that will help us rebuild and eventually retake Moscow,” Alexei said.\n\nYahontov rolled his eyes. “Mister Novikoff, I care deeply about honesty. I don't have time for the elevator pitch your interns wrote for you. Tell me what you want, or I'll enjoy my lunch alone."\n\n“Fine,” he said. Alexei looked Yahontov straight in the eye. “I want Feniks out of Zlatoust. They're forcing my neighbors and my family into the breadline.

As our team has grown, I've seen each of you grow with it. I am proud of every one of you.\n\nHowever, as the business environment in Western Siberia has developed, the company's leadership has grown concerned about our cost-to-revenue ratio. Our first priority as a fully owned subsidiary of Titan Group is to become profitable and to maximize our parent company's return on their investment.\n\nCompany leadership will be closely watching the development of the West Siberian elections. We're deeply concerned about regional dynamism and building a culture of opportunity and productivity in our new home. When I cast my vote, I'll be looking for a candidate that can return prosperity and freedom to Western Siberia. I'll be voting for someone who supports patriotic, pro-business policies that will help the Russian Federation rebuild and retake Moscow. Let's work together, as a team, to elect a candidate that will vote for your company, and your job.\n\nRemember, election day is a company holiday.\n\nDaan Van Dijk, Chief Executive Officer"

It was heavenly- the kind of sandwich he never could have made in the Anarchy. Shukshin, and the Federation, had done good by him. As Nikolai walked down the beaten country path, the portable radio he carried began to mutter.\n\n“Brothers and sisters of Western Siberia,” the advertisement began, “when you march to the polls this election day, vote for prosperity and patriotism. Vote for the pro-business policies we need to rebuild our home. Vote Alexei Novikoff!”\n\nNikolai smiled at his sandwich, and continued on his way to work.\n\nBy the time Nikolai arrived at the front gates of Titan Laboratory Equipment, Incorporated, his fingers were coated in tomato juice and egg yolk. With seven minutes before his shift started, he tip-toed to the men's bathroom, stopping on the way to offer a quick good morning to his good friend Ninel. Odd guy, but kind. As Nikolai scrubbed his calloused hands under a stream of cool water, dozens of posters emblazoned with the flag of the Federation loomed behind him. “A Vote For Novikoff is a Vote For Moscow!” one shouted. “Prosperity and Freedom - Patriotism and Liberty. Vote Novikoff!” its brother screamed.\n\nNikolai dried his hands, and continued on his way to work.\n\nAs he stepped onto the work floor, dozens of machines whirred before him, cutting glass, shaping plastic, and ejecting malformed product. He smiled. Looks like the night shift hadn't broken anything too important, for once. Nikolai strode to his workstation, affixed his safety goggles, and began his workday. Five minutes passed before Mr. Vinogradov, his supervisor, passed by his workstation.\n\n“Nikolai, hope you're doing well. How's the old girl doing?” he said.\n\nNikolai shot a smile at his manager. “Stronger than a mule's kick, sir. I think we'll make quota today,” he said.\n\nVinogradov nodded. “Good, I'll note that down. By the way, Corporate asked me to pass on that election day will be a company holiday.

You're going to cross the aisle.”\n\n“No, no, I can't do that. I won't do that,” Alexei said. “I started this campaign to help Zlatoust. To help my family. Porkryshin's party is in bed with Feniks! They'll tear my home to shreds.”\n\n“They're also in bed with us, my friend.”\n\n“Well, I don't work for Titan.”\n\n“Actually, you do,” Yahontov said. “We handed you the election on a silver platter. We pay your staff. We own the deed to your apartment in Novosibirsk. Hold on one second.” In the background, Alexei heard Yahontov yell something.\n\n“Sorry, there's an expense report I have to look over,” he said. “But I don't want you to focus on the negatives of this. With your vote, we'll be able to make major investments in Zlatoust and the entire West Siberian region. I've got a proposal on my desk to rebuild the Trans-Siberian railway. If that gets through the Duma, we can prioritize hiring Zlatousti businesses for local contracting. We can work together to make sure Feniks doesn't monopolize your home. But if you stick with Shukshin, I can't make that guarantee.”\n\nAlexei swore under his breath. “You're not making this easy for me, Mister Yahontov,” he said.\n\n“I wasn't trying to.

Dozens of important legislators and names-to-know milled about him, and yet he was completely alone.\n\n“Alexei!” a nameless man said. “So nice to see you!”\n\n“Good to see you too, my friend,” Alexi said. Who was that? He didn't look familiar at all, but surely Alexei must have met him once before. Perhaps in Barnaul? Or Irkutsk? There were so many faces, so many personalities to remember, and yet none of them had any substance. When he reached towards them, they evaporated like mist.\n\nA soft chime rang from the podium. Dozens of milling women and men quieted themselves as a besuited man in his early fifties strode onto the stage.\n\n“Ladies and Gentlemen,” he said, “thank you for joining our celebration this evening. It's a privilege and an honor to be able to speak with you.” He took a sip of water, and began his speech. “Prosperity. It's a word we've heard often from our dear friend, Senator Alexei Novikoff.” The room lit up with applause like a gas stove carelessly left on after dinner.  “But what does prosperity mean? Certainly it involves profit, and the growth of our businesses. But when I think of prosperity, I think of my family. My son, Boris, is seven years old. He needs a school. He needs friendships, and a community. And even if I have to drag him out the door by his ears, he's going to get a job!”\n\nThe crowd laughed in unison. Alexei found his mouth curling into a smile, but his heart felt like lead.\n\n“And so,” the speaker continued, “when I think of prosperity, I think of our families. Our communities. I think of striving towards a future worth living in. And I believe that prosperity will come from the success of Alexei Novikoff in the Federation Council.” He lifted his glass to offer a toast.\n\n“Congratulations, Alexei.

Towards the East, the symbols of Rurik and Saint Andrew stood watch like ancient sentries. Towards the West, the seal of the Novgorod Republic offered sanctuary, and the twin-headed eagle of the first Russian Republic flew high and free. And in the center, above the seals of Novosibirsk and Barnaul, the pristine flag of the Federation flew unshackled.\n\n“Thank you,” Alexei said. “It's been a difficult month.

Not to mention, I lost my apartment.”\n\n“Where are you sleeping?” Shukshin said.\n\n“My cousin has an apartment in East Novosibirsk,” Alexei said. “I didn't realize he had five children.”\n\nShukshin winced. “Good God.

But you made the right choice, breaking free of Titan; they would have kept you caged for the rest of your life.”\n\n“Thank you, Mr. President,” Alexei said. “Unfortunately, Titan and Feniks are already working to undermine me. Advertisements, plants in audiences, propaganda- just name it, and the Siloviks have already aimed it at me.”\n\n“The next election will be the most difficult of your life,” Shukshin said. “We'll do what we can.

You, the workers of Russia, have the power to change things for the better. You are the builders of this great society, and it is within your powers to change this society for the better. Help me uplift the workers of this great nation, and bring all of our people prosperity."\n\nA cough. Out of the corner of his eye, Kantorovich could see a few members of the crowd snickering. Most had assumed that the show had finished, and so began to leave the barely-filled park which Kantorovich had hoped might be the site of the next great spark of Russian revolutionary history. He raised a hand to call the crowd back, but stopped himself. It wouldn't matter; they weren't going to listen to him. Not yet, anyway.\n\nHe knew the fear that gripped their hearts. Some didn't want to have their homes raided for having 'Narodnik sympathies'. More believed that socialism had failed when the Soviet Union had collapsed, and that it would never be the ideology that would save Russia from the German threat. Kantorovich knew better. But how could he teach the people their error?\n\nKantorovich stepped off his haphazardly constructed podium, and stared out at what parts of Novosibirsk he could see. This wasn't a city ripe for revolution. It was a city that wanted peace. Prosperity. Kantorovich smiled to himself, thinking of all the mathematical problems he'd had to tackle when he was just a simple mathematician in the Soviet Union. Those were the real goliaths. All he needed to do was find the right equation, the right mixture of variables and circumstances, and he would bring socialism back from the brink."

It was early in the morning, so the sky still had that dull grayish-blue hue that made one want to rub the sleep out of their eyes even when there was none. The car passed by a town, or rather the remains of a town. All that remained of the lives that had lived here were the smoldering ruins of homes bombed to dust by the German Luftwaffe.\n\n"How many people do you think lived there?" Anatoly asked one of his companions who had joined him on this trek.\n\n"Huh?" One of the men answered, glancing back towards where Anatoly was looking. "Oh. I don't know. A couple hundred, maybe. Who cares? They're all gone."\n\n"I care," Anatoly responded, but said nothing more and let the back of the truck return to its somber silence. Yet the gears of his mind continued on unabated. He would care. He would not sit idly by any longer and allow the ravages of war to snuff out the lives of his countrymen. This cycle of destruction and violence had to end somewhere.\n\nYet, was it naive to think so? Anatoly looked back towards the ruined town as it began to recede into the gray distance. The men of that town would likely have wanted nothing more than to turn the fires which rain down on Western Russia day after day back onto the Germans, to show them the hatred that burned in their hearts. Perhaps mankind was fated to destroy itself in this endless cycle of violence, never to rise above barbarism.\n\nAnatoly shook his head at the thought. Nonsense. There was hope. There would always be hope. He turned away from where the truck was leaving, and looked towards where the truck was going. He could see the dull red outline of the sun rising in the east. In Siberia, he could make a new start. In Siberia, he could try and make a difference. In Siberia, the future was just waiting to be born."

From eating meals made of sawdust bread to working as a guard at shady brothels and clubs, Primakov was molded by the cold, unflinching environment that surrounded him. By stabbing the backs of both friend and foe he slowly ascended the food chain, and in the process had learned an essential truth: Man is selfish. Any man will do what they need to do to make it in the Land of the Strong. It's a win-or-lose society in the streets of Novosibirsk, and Primakov was no loser.  Despite what the naïve liberals in Barnaul or despicable Socialists in the country-side deluded themselves into denying, there is no idealistic, glorious future. Only the cold, unflinching truths of society.\n\nPrimakov let a faint smile creep across his tired face. Maybe one day he could indulge in the frivolous excesses and joys of life. These intruding thoughts quickly ceased in the face of a much louder intrusion banging on the door to his office.

"W-Who is that, standing near the door?"\n\n"That's Mr. Sokolov. We are not friends, Mr. Primakov. We are associates, if you must. What I need from you is a couple... favors, on behalf of our bosses.

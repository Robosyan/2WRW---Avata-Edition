 Koryagin.1.t:0 "Victory Shall Come"
 Koryagin.1.desc:0 "Ivan Kuratov gazed down at the banks of the Ob. Tears gathered in his eyes as he watched the sunrise with a smile. Across the small footbridge, a new era was beginning; hope and freedom were no longer myth.\n\nAnatoly Koryagin marched onto the podium where he would make his inauguration speech. His head was filled with sweat that he quickly moved to wipe away, while holding his hands steady. Taking quick glances down, he focused his gaze at the Novosibirsk skyline; the sunrise conveniently marked the dawn of his time as President. He then looked down at the people. They were not inhabitants of feudal fiefdoms or warlord states, no. They were Russians. Taking the opportunity to wet his lips and swallow, he steeled himself and began to speak.\n\n"Brothers and sisters of this land we call Russia. Several months ago, I promised you prosperity, peace, and a second era of Russian happiness should you have graciously placed your faith into me and entrustd with this post we all cherish: the Presidency of the Federation. Now, I can say this. We have won, and I will not forget these promises."\n\nThe crowd assembled below erupted into deafening sounds of joy and elation. Banners and flags went up in droves, and from Koryagin's position at least, a sea of white, blue, and red rose up to greet him.\n\n"For so long, Russia suffered under the yoke of one overlord after another. They've had time to burn and fester into our consciousness. We've all felt it in our bones. War has torn our families apart, destroyed our homes, our livelihoods, our cultures, and our faiths. We have all had to make sacrifices for our prosperity. But, we have emerged on the other side of the tunnel, and I look back on our struggles as a guide for the future. War has torn us apart, now we must heal. To do so, we must cast out our weapons and our hatred. We must abandon this pretense of might makes right. We must embrace a future of diplomacy, and optimism! Our neighbors across the seas and our neighbors at home are not the enemies at hand, not whilst Russians still suffer in the chains of poverty and injustice. We still have a long way to go."\n\nThe crowd was silent for a moment, before he raised a fist into the air, and said words that would reverberate in Russian history forever."

 Koryagin.2.t:0 "The Mess of Compromise"
 Koryagin.2.desc:0 "Koryagin took a sip of his coffee. It was Turkish in origin, cut with a strong pour of milk and the slightest hint of sugar. Just how he liked it. Once again, he traced his finger over the proposed route for his visit to the United States, the 'leader of the free world' and the other members of the OFN. "Let me get this straight," he began. "We're going to America in order to host a summit that could change the future of geopolitics. What we do here will either cement our legacy or destroy it, and you want me to waste time visiting a restaurant?"\n\nSergei Kovalev shrugged. "It's called fast food, Mister President, and it'll endear you to the Americans."\n\n"They think eating roadkill smashed between two pieces of bread is endearing?"\n\n"Yes! It makes you look like an everyman, a man of the people." Kovalev pushed his glasses back to the ridge of his nose. "It's only one meal, Anatoly."\n\nKoryagin sighed deeply. "And then what?"\n\n"We have several press conferences scheduled with the President of the United States. There'll be nothing major, a translator will be provided."\n\n"You think I need a translator?"\n\n"Do you think you need a translator?"\n\n"...I'm assigning you one."\n\nKoryagin balled his fists at his side. "Fine."\n\nSergei flipped to the next page in his itinerary. "Before the summit, you will be accepting honorary psychology degrees from several universities in America. Stanford, Harvard, and MIT."\n\n"I'm honoured, but... Sergei, is this really all necessary? Turning the trip into a show. Appeasing the public with nonsense."\n\n"Yes!" Kovalev slammed his pencil onto the table. "America is curious! They want to see the peacemaker of Eastern Europe, the man who changed Russia on a fundamental level. You told me you wanted to get involved, to change the world. Well, to do that, you need their attention. So let's get their fucking attention!""

 Koryagin.3.t:0 "A Plea Between Rivals"
 Koryagin.3.desc:0 "Kantorovich poured a drink for himself and his guest, Anatoly Koryagin. Once they may have been partners, but in the end, Anatoly was nothing but another arm of the corporate monopolies, a collaborator against the working class with the audacity to seek compromise with a servant of the people.\n\nStill, Koryagin attempted to plead with him. "Kantorovich, please. I know how you and your party may think of me, but I do not bow to corporations like some rich man's stooge. We cannot introduce these types of policies - nationalize Titan, Leonid? I'm not some kind of corporate lackey, but we can't just nationalize every company! I am fighting for peace, for the sake of prosperity, not for a paycheck, and I would work with honourable men like yourself to achieve it if you would only let me."\n\nKantorovich scoffed. "You give me the same spiel you tell your voters about 'peace', yet for all your talk of ideals and the greater good you oppose the very thing required for prosperity, advancement of the common man."\n\n"No, you misunderstand my pl-"\n\n"No Anatoly, I understand quite clearly. I am afraid we will not be able to come to an agreement." Koryagin paused for a moment, silent, before sighing and attempting to bounce back into the conversation.\n\n"Leonid, I know we do not see eye to eye, but think for a moment. Would you see Primakov and his goons succeed in tearing down all the work we've done because we aren't left-wing enough?"\n\nKantorovich nearly barked back a retort, but he stopped himself. Primakov was a very different case to the man beside him. Koryagin was an appeaser to corporate interests, but Primakov was a champion of the Siloviki! To refuse Koryagin his support would be to allow the Siloviks to gain the upper hand in government. The social liberals were not perfect, but if aiding them meant stopping, even if just from further harm, the destruction of the rights of the worker, maybe, just maybe...\n\nKantorovich turned to Koryagin, "Anatoly, I may think your policies are weak, but I do not wish to see the return of a Federation we fought so hard to leave in the past. If you will stop Primakov, you have the support of the DSPR.""

 Koryagin.4.t:0 "To Aid the Proud and the Many"
 Koryagin.4.desc:0 ""Ura!" Ivan cheered while raising a glass with his fellow soldiers of the 8th Battalion. It had been many years since they had liberated Europe as comrades in arms, but their bond proved unbroken even today when they gathered for drinks. All those around him still bore the scars of war, some very literally, but others in less obvious ways. Too many of his brothers-in-arms still struggled to put food on the table, even so, many years into peacetime.\n\nThe soldier's cheers were cut short as attention became drawn to the television in the corner of the room. President Koryagin was speaking at a press conference, though his words were barely audible in the room's noise. Ivan scoffed and began to return to his drink, after for all the President's talks of peace he had never seen a modicum of respect given to those who fought to achieve it, but Koryagin's words caught his and his fellow men's attention.\n\n"Starting today, I will begin to institute a new public works initiative that will see implementation across our great Federation, with priority employment given to all our brave sons of Russia who fought and suffered for its freedom. Jobs and a fair wage cannot be denied to those in need that sacrificed so much for all the nation, and we..."\n\nThe President continued on, but the brief pause of silence to hear his words fell as cheers and yells resumed. Many of the ex-soldiers still struggling cheered, some even gave a raised glass and a fierce, "Salud!" to the screen, but there were many that did nothing but scorn the announced wages which followed suit from the announcement.\n\nAnatoly, an adamant member of Kantorovich's DSPR, spoke up. "How can they give us the payment of slaves? This is barely over half of what we were given in the service!" Many in the room grumbled in agreement, but not everyone shared their offence to the paycheck offered. Many had been looking for a way out of destitution, no matter how, and Koryagin had just given it to them. It may not have been perfect, but to the soldiers in most dire need of a job it hardly mattered. Ivan decided he would have to wait and see what came of it, but for now? Back to his drink!"

 Koryagin.5.t:0 "In Memoriam"
 Koryagin.5.desc:0 ""In summary, these five young men, men with their whole lives ahead of them, were brutally and senselessly executed on no other grounds than the café they chose to enter one lazy afternoon. We will never know whether they were even aware of its use as a covert meeting place for socialist agitators, as they were denied the right to life just as they were denied the right to plead their case. They were set before superficial show trials and sentenced to death by a poisoned jury. Now that their case has been laid to rest, perhaps now, as a nation, our wounds can begin to heal."\n\nKoryagin looked out over the fairly sizable crowd which was in attendance as he finished his speech. Reception was going just as he hoped as he picked out from the masses a few notable journalists and politically active members of the moderate left. He could see many hopeful faces among the crowd. Perhaps the wounds of Pokryshkin's massacres would be healed after all.\n\nKoryagin's hopeful attitude dissipated the next morning as he had the grave misfortune of waking up to some newspapers dumped front and center on his desk. He picked one at random, he didn't quite recognize the title, but the Silovik-controlled tabloids tended to have a recognizable look. "President Koryagin Pardons Former Narodnik Terrorists! In The Pocket of Galanskov?"\n\nHe sighed as he tossed the paper onto the table. He couldn't say that it was unexpected. The President had no misconceptions about the fact that mending the Federation's broken political landscape was never going to be a walk in the park. He looked at another publication in the small pile and perked up with regained hope. This was a more moderate right-leaning voice - they surely would be more balanced in their journalism. "VRPP leadership has denounced the post-mortem pardoning of the Karakan Forest Five, citing-"\n\nKoryagin leaned forwards as he held his head in his hands. As he contemplated just how far-reaching the ramifications of his decisions could be, his reception buzzer sounded. He picked up the phone reluctantly and answered. "Sir, we've been getting reports of scattered protests throughout the country since yesterday. Initial reports seem to indicate clashing between socialist and Silovik supporters.""

 Koryagin.6.t:0 "The Falcon's Embers"
 Koryagin.6.desc:0 "It was certainly a strange sight to behold at the protests in the streets of Moscow, thought Second Lieutenant Kibarkov. After the reclamation war, he thought that maybe the agitators and unrest would be able to finally calm and the Federation's strife would begin to ease, but evidently that was a future never to come.\n\nThe protests around Koryagin's supposed favoritism towards the Narodniks had reached a breaking point. A proper demonstration had been organized by and rallied around a group of twelve veterans who, apparently, had served in every armed conflict since Hitler picked a fight with Bukharin.\n\nKibarkov's eyes wandered to the other end of the street, where the counter protests were taking place. Of course, supporters of the DSPR (and the SRs, and the KPRF) were rather fervently opposing this public action, because of course those damn communists would. All he could see, in either direction, was a sea of infuriated faces, blending together with signs and slogans, shouting their lungs out. The only thing separating the two groups were his friends and colleagues, covered in riot gear from head to toe.\n\nHours passed, but to the Second Lieutenant it felt like days. The chain of command refused to allow any violent dispersal methods unless provoked, so all there was to do was to hold the line, to pretend like the order of the whole city wasn't a hair's breadth from crumbling. It was freezing outside, but he could feel sweat run rivulets down his back as his eyes shot from one side to the other. Adrenaline pumped through his veins, but all he could do was wait, and hope beyond hope the day would not end in a bloodbath.\n\nSuddenly, as though God himself were smiling upon Moscow that day, the heavens opened up and blisteringly cold rain and hail poured upon the protestors. It was nothing short of a biblical storm, as pellets larger than golf balls struck the earth and the protesters, although defiant, were eventually dispersed by virtue of inclement weather alone.\n\nFor the longest seventeen hours of Kibarkov's life, the line was held and a confrontation was prevented. By virtue of random chance, political violence was avoided."

 Koryagin.7.t:0 "Land of Rice and Salt"
 Koryagin.7.desc:0 "The jet began to descend as the once-distant mountains grew larger as their plane approached them. These lands were a far cry from the harsh terrain of the Motherland, a different type of beauty, serene rather than unforgiving. They belied the scars wrought upon the land and people for the past century.\n\nKoryagin stepped down from the jet alongside Kovalev, being greeted by an entourage of villagers and Kuomintang soldiers. Before a crowd could form around them, their minders quickly led to the nearby village.\n\nThe houses were made of wood and stone, a stark contrast to the concrete forests of Russia. They felt strangely cozy despite the apparent austerity of their situation. Soon, Koryagin's enterouge entered a quaint house and sat at a round table covered by a simple tablecloth. Members of the Chinese general staff then joined them. Dishes were served in a grand circle so all could eat, steaming with a heavenly smell that wafted through the house. The fare was simple but sumptuous. As they picked and ate, their dealings began in earnest.\n\n"President Koryagin, we are truly honoured that you have deigned to cooperate with our small statelet. Both of our nations have been dismantled by fascism, but yours has risen once more, to heights never before seen by the Russian people. But China lies broken, shackled and splintered by the Japanese bandits. We will do our utmost to fight for the liberation of our people, but without external support, it seems unlikely even to the most optimistic of us."\n\nKoryagin looked at him with an understanding eye, "General Yu, we have not forgotten our struggle against the Nazis and how we at times had faced the same despair, considering the overwhelming odds that we had to surmount. Now that we have triumphed, we do not forget easily. We too face a common enemy in the Japanese and a greater one in the insidious shadow of fascism. We will not let the last beacon of hope in China sputter out. You have our full support, Haozhang.""

 Koryagin.8.t:0 "Into the Orient"
 Koryagin.8.desc:0 "Koryagin and Kovalev stepped off the jet and onto Indian soil for the first time in their lives. It was an oppressively humid day, cloudy like home, but unbearably hot. Moments after stepping off the plane, Koryagin could feel his shirt become damp with the passive humidity in the air, like breathing water itself.\n\n"Good afternoon, President Koryagin, Mr. Kovalev." a dark skinned man in a suit stepped out of a humble off-road vehicle, high-quality, but not ostentatious. "I am Ramesh Patel, and have the pleasure of being your translator and guide around India and Delhi. Welcome!" he beckoned to the car, "If you two would please?" The two men quirked an eyebrow, this wasn't the treatment they usually got in other countries, certainly not in a country with hundreds of millions. But, rejecting the urge to point it out, the two acquiesced for their innocent guide.\n\nThe ride was bumpy, and only once they got in with their bodyguards and their heavily armed caravan rode through the impoverished streets of Delhi did Koryagin notice the sheer destitution around them. Despite the fact that India's economy was large, that they had a far greater population than Russia, the people were starving. Poor, hungry, begging or selling wares, playing in the street with rags. Where were the schools?\n\n"Mister Patel, please excuse my ignorance, but are most areas in India suffering from such poverty?"\n\nPatel drove on for a moment before turning around, "It is not easy, President Koryagin. The soil requires heavy agricultural labor, but the people do not have land nor machine. If I may be honest with you, our country is corrupt, but it is moreso threatened on all sides by Japan and their puppets, and we are poor from a century of colonization. It will not be easy to overcome," he solemnly noted.\n\nThe ride passed in silence, stopping at a grand palace arranged in exquisite Muslim domes, contrasted brutally with the desperation not but a few blocks away.\n\nIn a pristine and garishly golden meeting room, an overly medallioned man looked at him. "President Koryagin, it is our honor to receive you, truly. But we desperately need your help against the fascist menace of Japan and their Afghan puppets. We cannot hope to develop ourselves without your cooperation." Koryagin's lips spread into a thin line."

A copy of the Voting Rights Act was hung near a photo of two men, who Koryagin recognized as the Federation's two ex-presidents, laughing beside a jet. The man with his hair flying in the wind looked so much younger than he appeared now behind the desk in front of Koryagin, though President Shukshin still had the same optimistic gleam in his eye.\n\n"Vasily, I'm glad to see you're well, but I'm afraid we must skip the pleasantries. I'm sure you know it's no secret that half the Duma is out to throw my administration to the wolves before it's gotten off the ground. The gridlock as it is can't be broken without more political backing, and I've come to ask your support."\n\nShukshin leaned into his chair and sighed, his polite smile faltering for a moment. "Anatoly, your idealism has never been well suited to politics. I would admire how persistent you are if it wasn't so asinine. If I learned anything from my time in your position it was that pleasing everyone is never feasible. You need some backbone or you won't get much further."\n\n"Vasily, please-"\n\n"The pacifism, the draft exemptions, it isn't practical, Anatoly. The voters will not stand for this. You need to be pragma-"\n\nKoryagin shot back, his voice rising. "Pragmatic? If we followed only what was pragmatic, that man," he jammed a finger toward the photo of Pokryshkin on the wall, "would still be in office! Vasily, you dragged us out of the anarchy and the dirt, picked a fight with a global superpower, and won! It was idealism that got us to where we are! You have pull, you have connections, damn it! I need your help if we want to stop Primakov and his thugs from undoing your work!"\n\nShukshin was silent for a long moment, weighing Koryagin's newfound resolve. "You are not necessarily wrong. I may have underestimated you, Koryagin," he chuckled. 'I like Primakov and his corporate parasites no more than you do. If your initiatives will stop them, I will help you. You may be naïve, but you are no coward, and for that, I can respect you. You will have the RAPP's support for a moderate democratic coalition.""

The VRPP will not stand for this!"\n\nAnatoly Koryagin gave him a pitying smile. "With all due respect Yevgeny, your party has little say in this. I have set the course. If we are to lead the world to peace, we must start by constructing an example. We can't do this with an extensive military-industrial complex plaguing the nation."\n\nThe leader of the All-Russian Patriotic Party sighed from exhaustion and finally collapsed into a chair. "Are you insane?" He wiped the sweat from his forehead. "This is ridiculous. It's not even about the bloody ability to project power in our sphere, this is the baseline long-term security of our people. Are we to hope that some madman like Hitler won't take power and try to slaughter our undefended people? These corporations that you are trying to weaken, do you know how many they employ? What they've contributed to Russia? You can't simply wish it away."\n\nKoryagin shrugged. "That is short-sighted, Yevgeny. The corporations may have employed people, but that kind of military capacity isn't the basis of a consumer economy. Our nation will have many guns, but no pantaloons, no televisions, the people cannot survive or make progress without a civilian economy."\n\n"Consumer economies won't survive in this world!" Primakov slammed a fist on the desk. "Look at Asia, look at the Middle East, look at the damn state of Europe! Do you think the other superpowers will be as stupid as to let themselves be disarmed and train their people not to further their geopolitical interests? You are forcing Russia to become a lamb, a lamb that will be slaughtered by those who do not follow your pretentious nonsense!"\n\n"I merely intend to train society with some empathy. To perceive others as they perceive themselves. Human beings shouldn't have the terrors of war inflicted on them for the foolish idea of our arbitrary 'geopolitical interests'. It's good business sense, too, Yevgeny. Countries will come around when their people produce more."\n\nPrimakov stood up. "I cannot stop you.

Another day of bureaucrats, diplomats, and think-tanks, all collectively working towards a simple goal. To remove 'war' from every dictionary. For eternal, prosperous peace. And as he stared at the nations of the late twentieth century, he felt the massive burden of the monumental task that awaited him and his followers.\n\nHow does a man teach the societies of East Asia to respect each other and work together after decades of false unity under a parasitic Sphere draining their economy? How does one approach Africa, her lands brutalized and her peoples maimed, where even baseline commodities such as water were scarce and fought over? How does one trample and suffocate the twisted European nationalism that arose from the ashes of the abominable Einheitspakt corpse? Is it possible to guide pan-Arabian tendencies in the Middle East towards regional stability?

 Koryagin.12.desc:0 "The sun shined brightly over the vast, blue skies of Moscow. It was the perfect scene from which to unveil the newly constructed memorial. A crowd in the hundreds gathered around the towering statue of a Russian soldier standing proudly at attention, hoisting the flag of his beloved Russia above his head. Beside him stood an American soldier, firmly saluting as well, and raising the flag of the United States so it flew aside the banner of the Federation.\n\nA touching piece, as thought by most passersby. Among the pedestrians walking past there were smiles, tears, and moments of silent remembrance, yet through it all there were more harsh remarks that were heard from the back of the crowd. Veterans, outraged at the thought of an American 'coward' made an equal to those who had truly liberated Russia. Amongst the crowd, their rage was understood, but none dared to interrupt their cries or give them solace.\n\nAs time passed the outcry dissipated, and in its place was not contempt or anger, but silence. A voiceless recognition of the feeling which encapsulated all who looked to the monument, a feeling that many believed to be lost to time: peace. In the silence, their eyes became drawn to the platform beside the memorial as a gathering of men in suits and ties made their way to the middle of the platform, where President Koryagin stepped out to give his commemoration speech.\n\n"I leave you all with the words of a great man, one from our friends across the sea, to remember as we enter into a new age of prosperity and freedom: 'The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.' Thank you." The crowd clapped respectfully in memoriam, though some were more vocal in their celebratory applause. Meanwhile, the veterans of the crowd grit their teeth in quiet anger, but stayed their voice in a brief moment of respect towards those who wished to celebrate, for this was a moment even they could not deny the importance of.\n\nNot long after midday, ambassadors from all corners of the free world shook hands together and gathered for a picture in front of the memorial. Democracy had won over the horrors of the Nazis. Through blood, sweat, and tears, they had triumphed over evil, and together they sang a song to victory evermore."

Nah man, I'm from Montana. This, good sir, is a normal day for me in December." Matthew loved messing with these Californian hippies, they were always complaining. Matthew was a God-loving guy from Montana, he could handle this type of weather.\n\n"If it ain't so bad, why don't you take off that coat and run two laps around the barracks," the Corporal barked back. Matthew's snide smile dissipated as he hurriedly retreated his eyes from Ron's glare and back to the letter he had received from his mother earlier that day which lay on the table. Lurching toward a nearby chair, Ron didn't bother to take off his coat as he sank his exhausted body into the seat. He lit a cigarette in a desperate attempt to reclaim enough body heat to make up for what he had lost.\n\nOnce again a crack at the door shifted both men's attention towards who had ended their brief respite from the cold. In walked Aydar, sporting a short-sleeved T-Shirt. "Friends, what seems to be problem? You wear coats inside, but you have heater, no?" Now, Aydar wore the infuriatingly coy smile, darting his eyes back and forth to both men, who shared the same confused, yet defeated, expression. With a warm smile, Aydar jeered, "Come my friends, we have drill in 15 minutes, just outside!" He gleefully chuckled at his two colleagues' flush red faces and tapped the Corporal on the shoulder. "Hey, no need to feel so embarrassed, yes? At least you are not Australian!" Adyar pointed to the squad of Australians on their way back from a march, whose tanned faces bore the look of defeated, half-frozen men.\n\nMatthew and Ron felt the weight of the next drill sinking in on them as Aydar waved farewell and swung the door open, ever so slightly longer than he should have, leaving both men once again shivering and feeling as though frostbite would set in at any moment."

But Koryagin remembered, the USA has not had any true threat to its existence in recent times, like Russia had. America has two great oceans between it and its enemies, the closest threat it ever had was the missile crisis in the 60s, even then that was a world away, abstract in its danger.

Suits and ties that came with the best intentions but usually fell short.\n\nWhile the car drove into Washington DC, Koryagin thought about life in America. It seemed peaceful, though there is tension in the air surrounding the newest president, Gus Hall, an open communist. Koryagin felt apprehensive, but ultimately thought he shouldn't make too many judgements before meeting him. Communism may have failed in Russia, but perhaps it was more suited to developed America. Besides, America still had its democratic system. This was but a single presidency, a very left-wing administration whose decisions could be reversed at a later date.\n\nAs he stepped out of the car, Koryagin happened to look at the road up ahead to see a horde of brown shirts. Pennsylvania Avenue had a crowd of people marching up it, directly towards the White House. Koryagin's bodyguards began ushering him away, but he wanted to see what they were marching about. Even though Koryagin couldn't understand English beyond pleasantries, he could recognize a protester when he saw one. The signs held slogans like 'COMMIE OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE', 'USA NOT USSR', 'YOCKEY WAS RIGHT'.\n\nKoryagin began to back away when two vans pulled in front of the crowd and riot police poured out. After some hesitation, the policemen began to push against the crowd, banging their shields on several men who had gotten to close to them. At the same time, members of the American Secret Service approached them.\n\n"Mister Koryagin, sir?" a translator spoke, "These men will take us to your meeting with President Hall." Koryagin nodded listlessly.\n\nEven though the American capital was beautiful in architecture, even as they walked through marble buildings and halls, Koryagin could only feel worried at what might happen next to America. A population so divided cannot remain intact, Russians know this better than anyone. He thought back to the quote from Abraham Lincoln:"

Meetings with the OFN delegation members, U.S. Senators, Congressmen, and so-on. Suits and ties that came with the best intentions but usually fell short.\n\nAs the car made its way through Washington D.C., Koryagin noticed something strange. The streets were empty, as if the entire country were in hiding. Koryagin had heard about the controversy surrounding America's president, Francis Yockey, but he didn't think it would be this bad. What was happening that he hadn't heard about?\n\nHe got out of the car near Pennsylvania Avenue, right next to the White House. As he looked around, he realized that here too the city seemed dead. Nobody wandered the streets, the stores had closed, no cars drove. It was like something out of a horror film. He walked towards the White House when he was surprised to see somebody, before realizing it was just a member of the police.\n\nBut as he walked closer he realized his uniform was off, this wasn't a policeman, this looked like a brown shirt. Koryagin ushered his translator to come over before asking "Where is everybody?" The militiaman seemed confused before explaining "The city is currently on a look out for traitorous elements, so far thousands have been found to be harboring Judeo-Bolshevist sentiments." At that point Koryagin realized what had truly happened to America. He walked away from the militiaman, then calmly explained to Kovalev that he was canceling all meetings. America had died. What remained was simply a matter of what it's shambling corpse would do."

 Koryagin.18.t:0 "A Trip to Barnaul"
 Koryagin.18.desc:0 "Anatoly Koryagin slowly withdrew the small, crumpled note from his shirt pocket. Barely making out its contents in the dim light afforded to him by the moonlit night.\n\n"Shukshin Residence - Room 18. Room... 19? No, 18. We all start from somewhere I suppose."\n\nCarefully inserting his rusted key into the apartment door, he didn't know what to expect stepping into the darkness. Certainly not the dozen or so boxes that immediately collapsed on top of him upon making his entrance.\n\n"..Jesus Christ, that could've killed me! What the hell is he doing keeping all of this trash here anyways? Does he always live like this?"\n\nFlipping on the barely-functioning light switch, Koryagin quickly realized just why there so was much 'trash'. The apartment was essentially a one-room flat. Flanked by a humble worn-out cot to the left and an old wooden desk on the right, it didn't leave any real space for storage. Much less for the hundreds and hundreds of letters that now scattered the cramped floor of the apartment.\n\n"Well, I guess that adds up. Finding one single report out of this mess is going to take hours. Should've sent my secretary when I had the chance." Koryagin mumbled, shifting through pile after pile of dust-covered papers in aimless search.\n\nCuriously, Koryagin idly grabbed a single envelope just to see what was inside. A small handwritten note, accompanied by a crudely-drawn man, presumably Shukshin, standing next to a family of three equally simple people.\n\n"Dear Shuuksin. My mom said my dad likes you. I dont see him anymore. But if he likes you then I like you to.' Koryagin stared at the note in silence, complete with childish mistakes.\n\nSetting the letter back in the box, he noticed another small slip of paper inside the envelope. A return note, written in clearer handwriting."

 Koryagin_News.1.desc:0 "President Koryagin has officially announced, in conjunction between broadcasts from the White House in Washington and the Federal Assembly in Novosibirsk, Russia's entry into the Organization of Free Nations.\n\nWith the end of the Second West Russian War came the re-establishment of free elections in the Federation, which allowed for the Social Liberals, led by dark-horse Anatoly Koryagin, to lead the government. Promising increased international cooperation and a reduction in military spending, the RSLP made great efforts to reach out to other 'bastions of democracy', increasing regional commitments and expanding economic links through trade.\n\nWhile some see the announcement as a renewed confirmation of Washington's grip on the free world, their is no doubt that Russia's entry into the organization will substantially increase its presence across the globe. With the Reich in flames and Japan's Sphere facing ever-increasing resistance in its dominions, this act has merely solidified the new global order for years to come."

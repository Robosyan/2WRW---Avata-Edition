 NOV_shukshin_federation_of_hope:0 "A Federation of Hope"
 NOV_shukshin_federation_of_hope_desc:0 "After decades of chaos, division and despair, a new hope has emerged in the once broken lands of Russia in the form of the Russian Federation. Yet across the nation, in both liberated and occupied lands, our people are unsure of the future that lies ahead for their Motherland.\n\nMany fear that the Federation is just another regime in the long line of dictatorships that has ruled Russia since the nation first appeared in 1547. Others believe the Federation is nothing more than the mere reincarnation of the failed Central Siberian Republic. Others falsely compare our security services to the NKVD.\n\nWe are not an extension of the horrors and failures of the past. We are the Russian Federation, the best and only hope our Motherland has to endure this dark world."
 
 NOV_shukshin_laying_the_groundwork:0 "Laying the Groundwork"
 NOV_shukshin_laying_the_groundwork_desc:0 "The President's first order of business, and by extension the RAPP's, is to completely transform the borderline stratocratic State Duma into a fully functioning democratic government that truly represents the people of Russia.\n\nNaturally, there has been opposition from both the Siloviki and parts of the Russian public in response to our desire to completely transform the current political establishment.\n\nIf we are to continue the democratisation of the Russian Federation, we will need to assure the public and work with others in order to achieve a term the President himself has coined...\n\n§mPragmatic Democracy.§!"
 
 NOV_shukshin_introduce_the_concept:0 "Introduce the Concept"
 NOV_shukshin_introduce_the_concept_desc:0 "After much arguing and plannning among members of the §BRAPP§! and the President himself over how the party plans to achieve their goal of '§mPragmatic Democracy§!', the President and senior officials of the RAPP have presented a concept to the State Duma which aims to answer how they plan to achieve these ambitious goals.\n\n§YThe Federal Assembly§!\n\nAn old concept made years ago during the early days of the Central Siberian Republic, it has been reintroduced to the halls of government, revamped to better suit the needs of the Russian Federation and the goals of democratising the nation."
 
 NOV_shukshin_work_with_the_siloviki:0 "Work with the Siloviki"
 NOV_shukshin_work_with_the_siloviki_desc:0 "While the Siloviki are most certainly our adversaries, they are the second most influential organisation in Russia with great political influence over both the nation and the Duma.\n\nIf we are to reform the Duma into government suited for the President's vision for '§mPragmatic Democracy§!', it would be be we reach out to the more moderate members of the Siloviki and work out a compromise in order to get this new government off the ground.\n\n§YEven if this means granting them more influence over the Federation's reformed political system.§!"
 
 NOV_shukshin_a_deal_with_the_new_parties:0 "A Deal with the New Parties"
 NOV_shukshin_a_deal_with_the_new_parties_desc:0 "Since the annexation of Western Russia into the Federation, new political organisations and parties have quickly gained influence in our government, some even making their way into the State Duma. The strongest parties of this bunch are the pacifist RSLP and the democratic socialist DSPR.\n\nIf our aim to create a new and inclusive multi-party government which serves the need of '§mPragmatic Democracy§!', it would be wise to reach out to these parties and work with them in order to form a coalition government of pluralistic democracy.\n\n§YEven if it means conceding some of our own political influence in the Federation's reformed political system.§!"
 
 NOV_shukshin_establish_the_party_registry:0 "Establish the Party Registry"
 NOV_shukshin_establish_the_party_registry_desc:0 "Beyond the RAPP, there doesn't exist any proper political parties within the Federation beyond a mess of special interest groups, loose political coalitions and military men. A big part of the formation of a '§mPragmatic Democracy§!' is keeping the entire system simple while simultaneously being both effcient and democratic.\n\nIf we're gonna keep things relatively simple in the Russian government, we should establish a set of rules and guidelines for any political party wishing to join government to ensure that the Federation has properly defined parties representing the people in the Federal Assembly."
 
 NOV_shukshin_assure_the_nation:0 "Address the Nation"
 NOV_shukshin_assure_the_nation_desc:0 "Since the reunification of Russia under the banner of the Federation, much of the nation and by extension the world, is unsure of President Shukshin's intentions in office beyond vague promises of reform, environmentalism and anti-corporatism made during his election campaign.\n\nIt's time for the President to take the stand in Novosibirsk before the nation and the world and reveal to all precisely what the goals of a reunited Russian state will be moving forward."
 
 NOV_shukshin_root_out_corruption:0 "Root Out Corruption"
 NOV_shukshin_root_out_corruption_desc:0 "Corruption is a cancer that has been slowly eating away at the political and social fabric of the Federation. It had been allowed to run rampid during the rule of the Siloviki as it was corruption that allowed them to maintain the reigns of power for as long as they did.\n\nWith them mostly out of the picture, its time to begin taking measures to tackle the political virus that is corruption. In order to do so, the President has ordered the Sluzhba Bezopasnosti to begin a secret internal investigation of the government to root out the most corrupt of the government and to send the message out to those who seek to undermine Russian Democracy.\n\n§YCorruption will not be tolerated.§!"
 
 NOV_shukshin_restrict_lobbying:0 "Restrict Lobbying"
 NOV_shukshin_restrict_lobbying_desc:0 "Since the founding of the Federation in the early 50's, the corporations of §YTitan§!, §GSibir§! and §PFeniks§! have used their vast monetary resources to influence the officers and politicans of the State Duma.\n\nWhile this may have been acceptable under the reign of Alexander Pokryshkin, with the promise to Pragmatic Democracy underway, this cannot be permitted to continue any longer.\n\nThe RAPP may not have the means to stop all corporate influence on the representatives of the Russian people, there are ways we can restrict lobbying and reduce their sway in government."
 
 NOV_shukshin_the_federal_assembly:0 "The Federal Assembly"
 NOV_shukshin_the_federal_assembly_desc:0 "Much time has pasted since Shukshin's inaugration to the Presidency and at last, he and the RAPP have finally secured their first major victory since the reunification of the Motherland.\n\n§YThe offical creation of the Federal Assembly§!\n\nThe first major piece in the mission to achieve '§mPragmatic Democracy§!', it is designed to represent the will of the Russian people and ensure the preservation of democratic principles within the Federation.\n\nWith the first major hurdle out of the way, we can now begin to move our focus onto other important issues in the Federation that require the government's attention and bring forth a better Russia for the Russian people."
 
 NOV_shukshin_an_equal_federation:0 "An Equal Federation"
 NOV_shukshin_an_equal_federation_desc:0 "We call ourselves a nation of our people - yet hundreds of thousands lack access to even the basic necessities of life. How can we call ourselves a 'nation of the people?'. Our ideals of equity within the Federation must be restored by Shukshin lest we become more hypocritical than the enemies of the Federation.\n\nWith a proposed bill by Shukshin, he must pick a side to support him, the DSPR or RSLP, but that must be put aside from now. For there will be universal equity, suffrage, and freedom for all in the Federation!"
 
 NOV_shukshin_reach_out_to_the_dspr:0 "Reach Out to the DSPR"
 NOV_shukshin_reach_out_to_the_dspr_desc:0 "We always knew that building a true democracy wouldn't be easy. But the pushback we have received from the megacorporations and their benefactors has been especially fierce.\n\nFortunately for us, the fruits of our newfound pluralism are paying dividends, and our fellows in the DSPR are eager to support our enfranchising endeavors. Though we are by no means natural allies, our pride means nothing when the noble voice of every Russian hangs in the balance."
 
 NOV_shukshin_a_common_ideal:0 "A Common Ideal"
 NOV_shukshin_a_common_ideal_desc:0 "The Women's Rights Act has proven to become a truly unifying endeavor against the VRPP. The Social Liberals have shown strong support for the ideals of the bill, and it would be only natural to reach out to their Party in an effort to gain the votes needed to pass this revolutionary step in women's suffrage.\n\nOf course, this will not be without consequence. By allying with them, we are sure to improve their legitimacy in the eyes of the people and further their political momentum. This may not prove to be a terrible consequence, but it is nevertheless a factor to be considered, especially in matters of other opposition factions. Still, we will do what we must, for the women of the Federation."
 
 NOV_shukshin_the_first_of_many:0 "The First of Many"
 NOV_shukshin_the_first_of_many_desc:0 "Success At Last! We have managed to get enough support in the Duma for the passing of the Voters Rights Act. This is an excellent first victory for suffrage in the Federation, but it will not be the last. The Act has now thankfully been able sped through government bureaucracy and will set the stage for new reforms and laws for years to come.\n\nFinally, we shall be able to look forward to our future knowing the most universal right of the people is now protected, and our dreams of a free and equal Federation grow ever nearer. The right of people to elect their government, freely and fairly, will be disrupted never again."
 
 NOV_shukshin_cut_the_red_tape:0 "Cut the Red Tape"
 NOV_shukshin_cut_the_red_tape_desc:0 "Under the Siloviki, the Federation instituted a veritable mountain of red tape used as a weapon against any and all opposition to ensure their grip on power was absolute. One of the foremost problems this created was the bureaucratic issues that arose in attempting to form new political parties, making it in practice nearly impossible.\n\nIt would be considered by some a pointless task to attempt to unravel the mess holding back government bureaucracy, but the Federation and its President have no intentions of letting this stop them. We will slash government bureaucracy so we may pave the way for a truly pluralist Russia, piece by piece."
 
 NOV_shukshin_establish_the_electoral_committee:0 "Establish the Electoral Committee"
 NOV_shukshin_establish_the_electoral_committee_desc:0 "Of all the corruption and destitution that arose from the Siloviki, it was nowhere more apparent than the electoral system. Under Pokryshkin, gerrymandering and intimidation became the norm, causing poll numbers to unrepresentatively fall for the enemies of the Silvoki and rise for their goons. These sadly common practices hampered and delegitimized all components of the government, but no longer will we allow this to happen.\n\nWe will establish an independent electoral committee to ensure the people will always have their voice in their government. The dream of a Federation of the people comes ever so slightly closer to reality as we banish the remnants of the Siloviki."
 
 NOV_shukshin_expand_the_bill:0 "Expand the Bill?"
 NOV_shukshin_expand_the_bill_desc:0 "Among the many voices heard in the halls of government, there is one group that hasn't yet seen its calls answered: the women of the Federation. Our efforts are meaningless if we disregard such a large swath of our constituency, which is why our recent measures to expand voting rights must include them. After all, can we truly be equal if we do not extend our support to women's suffrage in the same way as all others have seen?\n\nOf course, it won't be easy to generate support for this measure, but we cannot claim to be acting on behalf of the people when we ignore millions of our own population."
 
 NOV_shukshin_rally_the_coalition:0 "Rally the Coalition"
 NOV_shukshin_rally_the_coalition_desc:0 "For the Voting Rights Act to pass, we must cooperate with our coalition. We shall associate ourselves with them further, and work together to realize our collective ambition. Though this shall hamper our electoral dominance in the government as a whole, it is a needed compromise."
 
 NOV_shukshin_gather_independent_party_support:0 "Gather Independent Party Support"
 NOV_shukshin_gather_independent_party_support_desc:0 "Fortunately for our efforts to pass our Voting Rights Act into law, independent and minor parties within the Duma have come to our aid to rally against the VRPP. We shall curry favor with these normally unseen members of our government so we may be able to pass this bill for the sake of the people.\n\nWhile normal circumstances would not endear us to these radical elements, a unified struggle in the fight for our Federation against those who would see democracy dead must be pursued. While this shall give them more strength and embolden independent government elements, it is better than letting our efforts for this monumental bill be for nothing."
 
 NOV_shukshin_womens_rights_act:0 "Women's Rights Act of [GetYear]"
 NOV_shukshin_womens_rights_act_desc:0 "At long last, after months of restless struggle, the Women's Rights Act has finally been sent through the Duma to be voted on promptly. Some believed this day would never come, thinking the corporations and their puppets would strike it down, but we have triumphed in our quest to bring universal suffrage to all who cry out for freedom in our land.\n\nRegardless of their income, political opinion, or gender, all in the Federation will soon be able to vote for representation in their government. Of all our victories, this may prove to be our greatest yet. We have finally achieved true progress and equality in what was once a system built against the masses, and now will work at their behest."
 
 NOV_shukshin_your_right_to_unite:0 "Your Right to Unite"
 
 NOV_shukshin_ode_to_the_people:0 "Ode to the People"
 NOV_shukshin_ode_to_the_people_desc:0 ""President Shukshin could never have achieved his accomplishments without the people of the Federation. Our administration owes its every triumph to the people, for without them control of the state could never have been wrestled from the corporations and the Siloviki.\n\nIn accordance, the people who lifted the President into office will become the first and foremost to be considered in policy. The Federation is changing swiftly, and every advance towards a freer nation will be taken with the common man, not the oligarch, in our hearts and minds. As we build a new Federation, we will honor the masses who made it possible.""
 
 NOV_shukshin_our_nations_health:0 "Our Nation's Health"
 NOV_shukshin_our_nations_health_desc:0 ""Possibly one of Russia's most egregious oversights throughout its history has been the health of its people. Since the days of the Tsar, the healthcare system of the nation has been underfunded and overlooked by the leaders of the country. But this will continue no more.\n\nOur efforts towards a healthier Federation, free of illness, must be pursued with the same vigor as any of our goals. Vast investment into the Federation's healthcare in an effort to remedy the mistakes of the past must be implemented for the sake of a prosperous and healthy people. Our efforts mean nothing if our people continue to suffer from our neglect.""
 
 NOV_shukshin_a_pragmatic_solution:0 "A Pragmatic Solution"
 NOV_shukshin_a_pragmatic_solution_desc:0 "As is expected of any government, it is imperative we provide adequate healthcare to our citizens. As of now, the nation's healthcare is controlled by the megacorporations and their snide leaders who grasp at any opportunity for power, a case no different in the medical field than any other.\n\nThe VRPP believes that we should reform the healthcare system, but within reason. They propose that with the Federation's currently below adequate budget, minor reforms to make the best of the current system would be preferable to more drastic measures. The corporations may still hold their power, but it is a start until our financial situation can improve."
 
 NOV_shukshin_pact_with_the_rslp:0 "A Pact with the RSLP"
 
 NOV_shukshin_the_DSPRs_conscious:0 "The DSPR's Conscious"
 NOV_shukshin_the_DSPRs_conscious_desc:0 "The newly emergent Democratic Socialists have approached the President with a proposition: the complete nationalization of the Federation's healthcare system. In a joint effort between them and ourselves, we will work to take the health of the people out of the hands of the rich.\n\nThis action is not taken lightly, but it is done as what the DSPR consider a moral necessity. The corporations and their greed will have one less means of control, and our people and their health will likely benefit as a result. However, this undertaking will not be without its costs. The size and spending of our government may need to increase dramatically, but it is a necessity for our first priority: the people."
 
 NOV_shukshin_expand_healthcare_funding:0 "Expand Healthcare Funding"
 NOV_shukshin_expand_healthcare_funding_desc:0 "The basis upon which our Federation was founded was an effort to protect the people of Novosibirsk in their darkest hour, yet even today we fall short in achieving this goal for all Russians. Untold lives have been lost for the benefit of the megacorporations and their wallets through private healthcare. Only the rich receive service, as those under them rot away.\n\nTo begin to remedy this plague upon the nation, we will redirect expenses and increase the national budget to flood our measly healthcare system with an influx of revenue. We can only hope with this the healthcare system shall finally serve its true purpose, lest our people lose more."
 
 NOV_shukshin_drug_pricing_controls:0 "Drug Pricing Controls"
 NOV_shukshin_drug_pricing_controls_desc:0 "With the sad state of our nation's healthcare, we must closely watch the companies who dominate the industry. Like the megacorporations operating above them, they see those they treat as sources of profit and not as people in a gross perversion of the field. In an effort to keep their lust for money in check, we will institute price caps on medication.\n\nWhile this will certainly dent the Federation's budget, it is a necessity for the people so they may finally live without fear of their savings being drained with a simple trip to the pharmacist. With this legislation we work towards a system of healthcare that truly works for all, not only the rich."
 
 NOV_shukshin_propose_universal_coverage:0 "Propose Universal Coverage"
 NOV_shukshin_propose_universal_coverage_desc:0 "Officials within the DSPR have drafted the Universal Coverage Act, which if passed may potentially become one of the greatest edicts to ever go through the doors of the Duma. With one bill, all healthcare services would be placed under the control of the Federation directly and away from the megacorporations.\n\nShould it pass, we will have both dealt a great blow to the megacorporations and immeasurably improved the lives of our citizens. There is no doubt the corporations will attempt to retaliate, but we shall stand ready against their efforts at all costs for the good of the Federation and its people."
 
 NOV_shukshin_russian_cultural_rebirth:0 "Rebirth of Russian Culture"
 NOV_shukshin_russian_cultural_rebirth_desc:0 "For decades Russian culture has been swept away in the chaos of the Smuta as the people became more focused on their survival than tradition or art. Many of our cultural works and achievements have begun to fade into history, but this will stand no more. To return Russia to greatness, we must first rejuvenate its culture.\n\nThe slow decay of Russian contributions to the arts and culture must come to an end. Whether young or old, the people of Russia will be able to remember their heritage of greatness from a simpler age, when people focused on happiness and not fear."
 
 NOV_shukshin_pride_and_patriotism:0 "Pride and Patriotism"
 NOV_shukshin_pride_and_patriotism_desc:0 "With so much pain and sadness within our nation, the people are hesitant to believe we can assume the mantle left to us as the last light of freedom in Russia. The people need a Federation to believe in, a strong nation which will protect her children from invaders and occupiers alike, a loving Russia who stays by her children, through war and disease.\n\nThe people shall be inspired, whether today or the next they will regain their faith in their country. We can only hope once more Russia will be a strong nation which our people can take pride in, not a land of nothing but woe and strife."
 
 NOV_shukshin_encourage_new_thought:0 "Encourage New Thought"
 NOV_shukshin_encourage_new_thought_desc:0 "With the recent reunification of Russia under the Russian Federation, Shukshin is at a crossroads. With the VRPP proposing a system of 'Patriotism' and 'Pride', the DSPR and RSLP have come to him with a proposal.\n\nRather than encouraging pride and patriotism above all else - Russia will become a nation of philosophy, a nation of freedom and liberty, and a nation of its people. A nation of culture, a nation where all can think or speak freely. We will embrace our true calling, that of prosperity, of wisdom, and above all else - Russia."
 
 NOV_shukshin_subsidise_scientific_endeavours:0 "Subsidise Scientific Endeavours"
 NOV_shukshin_subsidise_scientific_endeavours_desc:0 ""If the great powers of the world share one common trait, it is their uncompromising efforts towards the newest advancements in the sciences. If we are to emulate their success, we must emulate their strides made in scientific research.\n\nFor Russia to stand as an equal on the global stage, redoubling the money and attention given to our labs and research facilities must be made a priority of utmost importance. A strong institutional focus on the progress of human knowledge must be pursued, both at the broader level and in the proper educating of every current and future scientific genius in our state. The betterment of Russia will start in the laboratory.""
 
 NOV_shukshin_revolutionise_school_equipment:0 "Revolutionise School Equipment"
 NOV_shukshin_revolutionise_school_equipment_desc:0 ""It would be a disservice to the sciences to act as if they require nothing more than shoving a degree into one's hands and stuffing them into a lab coat at a research facility. The advancement of knowledge is just as much a social endeavor as it is material, and our pursuit towards it must begin in every citizen, most importantly the young.\n\nSchool funding and equipment for scientific studies must be renovated from the ground up. Every microscope, every beaker, must be up to the standards needed to create a generation ready to continue and further science beyond any who came before them. Every ruble put into this most sacred effort guarantees the prosperity of the Federation for decades to come.""
 
 NOV_shukshin_expand_the_central_design_bureau:0 "Expand the Central Design Bureau"
 NOV_shukshin_expand_the_central_design_bureau_desc:0 ""The Central Design Bureau acts as the central and foremost center for the Federation's research and development in science and technology. It is the head from which our scientific strides are coordinated and directed, and a body is only as capable as its brain allows, especially in science.\n\nIf we are to truly revolutionize our nation's advancement of knowledge, it must begin at the Central Design Bureau. The power and prosperity of the Federation depends on its success. Only a small spark is needed to cascade into a flurry of knowledge, and this starts at the center of the nation's research. All we have to do is give the first push.""
 
 NOV_shukshin_the_peoples_president:0 "The People's President"
 NOV_shukshin_the_peoples_president_desc:0 ""President Shukshin is in every way an entirely different beast to his predecessor. His mandate to govern comes not from the bullet of a gun or the wallet of the rich, but his own people. This has never been forgotten, through every act and bill, the people and their happiness have always been at the forefront of importance.\n\nThe President's efforts have truly earned him the title of President of the people. Russia's citizens deserve nothing short of leadership with the truest of intentions, and this is something which the President has given them. Not with empty gestures, not with false promises, but by doing what he feels is best, the corporations and their bribes be damned.""
 
 NOV_shukshin_cross_the_aisle:0 "Cross the Aisle"
 NOV_shukshin_cross_the_aisle_desc:0 "In our great fight against corporate supremacy, we must begin to acquire allies. And so, what better allies than those whose sole purpose is the empowerment of the Russian worker? The members of the DSPR are our best shot at effectively taking down corporate power, with many among them having waited years for a bill like this to come along.\n\nWith the charisma of President Shukshin, and the passion and popularity of the DSPR, we will finally tear down one of the last obstacles to a truly equal Federation. Soon, the dreams Shukshin once only possessed in his mind will come to fruition."
 
 NOV_shukshin_economic_liberation:0 "Economic Liberation"
 NOV_shukshin_economic_liberation_desc:0 "For our Federation to be truly free, more is needed than simple ballot boxes. The people cry out for another, fundamental type of liberation: that of the economy. We shall make a renewed effort into bringing the people a freer workplace so that their wages shall not be held hostage and their lives will not be of nothing but constant squalor.\n\nThe people will be held hostage by faceless corporate overlords no more, but instead have freedom and choice in the workplace, a dream once thought unachievable in the Federation. No longer will their lives be only to line the pockets of the establishment, but to seek out their own destiny."
 
 NOV_shukshin_a_helping_hand:0 "A Helping Hand"
 NOV_shukshin_a_helping_hand_desc:0 "With the years of anarchy in the Russian Wastes, millions within our federation remain under the poverty line, not even having the capability to afford any water or food - let alone the luxuries that Shukshin's Federation supplies. This cannot stand.\n\nWith the help of the other parties in the Federation, Shukshin has introduced a bill to support those less fortuned by society. The people who were forsaken by the previous warlords shall be raised back into greatness, and we will reforge Russia into what it once was, a nation of millions, united and prosperous."
 
 NOV_shukshin_with_strength:0 "With Strength"
 NOV_shukshin_with_strength_desc:0 "With the bill being proposed, we have decided to take the unorthodox choice of cooperating with the VRPP for our poverty programme, reaching out to the former dictators of Novosibirsk to support our citizens in collaboration with us.\n\nWith the VRPP's connection to the Megacorp Oligarchs, they can easily establish deals with them to increase the amount paid to workers, and the amount of workers hired, mainly due to some 'liberties' given to them to allow them to continue… less civil practices, and with targeted welfare to those who seem to have pride in their motherland; our people shall both be rejuvenated in their patriotism and rescued from their poverty."
 
 NOV_shukshin_with_hope:0 "With Hope"
 NOV_shukshin_with_hope_desc:0 "With Shukshin's poverty bill being proposed, he has personally worked out a deal with the RSLP to ensure it's passing with the support of both parties. With th RSLP's moderate and populist strategy, the nation can mitigate an easy yet effective way to lift our citizens out of their poverty.\n\nWith the RSLP plan, hundreds of welfare plans would be instituted across the Federation, allowing those who were formerly stuck and trapped in bankruptcy or debt finally had a way into restoring their riches, and with the nations support of small business, those who formerly would've abandoned their post as a business owner will now have the opportunity to finally stake out a position in their competition."
 
 NOV_shukshin_with_sympathy:0 "With Sympathy"
 NOV_shukshin_with_sympathy_desc:0 "With Shukshin's bill being proposed, we have decided to gain support from the Socialists in the DSPR, being the most radical stance on the bill - believing it to even be too moderate in some circumstances. However, with their compromise, no cost will come to our own people and civilians.\n\nWith the support of the DSPR, the rights of Unions within the corporations will be strengthened immensely, allowing those abused by the system to remain in their position and be free from unfair displacement from their workplace - leading to inevitable bankruptcy. Workers rights will also be strengthened, so that we can finally confine poverty as one of the monsters of the past!"
 
 NOV_shukshin_support_small_business:0 "Support Small Business"
 NOV_shukshin_support_small_business_desc:0 "The Federation of old consistently made itself an enemy of small business. Under President Pokryshkin, we strung them up in red tape and favored the government's corporate backers over the needs of the working man. Now, we will rectify this issue that has plagued the Federation for decades. No longer will red tape engulf small businesses, no longer shall our economy hold them back.\n\nSpecial provisions will be granted to up-and-coming stores so they may survive and thrive in our economy. Beginning today, we bring the Federation of the Siloviki and of yesterday one step further from memory, and a new Federation of hope and dreams of tomorrow one step closer."
 
 NOV_shukshin_provisions_against_famine:0 "Provisions Against Famine"
 NOV_shukshin_provisions_against_famine_desc:0 "In President Shukshin's time as mayor of Barnaul, he came to intimately understand the importance of supply routes in feeding the Federation's people. In accordance, we shall remake supply lines across Russia so that all its people may have a consistent food supply. If we are to truly rebuild the Federation and its land we must never live in fear of famine ever again.\n\nThe agricultural centers and infrastructure of Russia shall see sweeping modernization in an effort towards our goal of a famineless Russia. With this bold new plan, even the most isolated of villages will be able to receive their grain provisions, through fire and flame if necessary."
 
 NOV_shukshin_the_workers_protections_act:0 "Workers Protections Act"
 NOV_shukshin_the_workers_protections_act_desc:0 "The current conditions of our workplace are beyond miserable. If we should claim to be a developed country this cannot go on like this again. We are far behind in many amenities and resources other countries have for their workers.\n\nFrom the safety being horrid and workers barely having benefits and rights, with our Workers Protection Act, this shall be no more. Now our workers will feel safe and secure in their working environments."
 
 NOV_shukshin_fend_off_the_corporations:0 "Fend Off the Corporations"
 NOV_shukshin_fend_off_the_corporations_desc:0 "The accursed megacorporations of the Federation have corrupted and ruined every life and inch of land in Russia with their greed and desire for power. From the first days of our nation during the Smuta to now, they have dominated every facet of our government and nation.\n\nAll of the work we have done to better the nation has the potential to be desecrated and left in ruin by the whims of these corporate suits and their cronies. We must cut them down to size before they attempt to see our hopes of a better tomorrow dashed before being brought to fruition. As we have done since President Shukshin took office, we shall continue to whittle them down until they are nothing."
 
 NOV_shukshin_implement_tax_reform:0 "Implement Corporate Tax"
 NOV_shukshin_implement_tax_reform_desc:0 "As the citizens of the Federation pay their fair share in taxes for the greater good of the nation, a handful of corporate suits are allowed to escape their civil duties for no benefit other than their own pocketbooks. It is an absolute disgrace both to both the people and to the government that they are allowed to escape the rule of law on no other basis than greed.\n\nTo combat this, we have begun to institute extensive Corporate taxes to bleed them of their most basic of revenue streams. A true, effective beginning to correcting the corporate plague upon our lands begins with this legislation."
 
 NOV_shukshin_subsidise_family_farms:0 "Subsidise Family Farms"
 NOV_shukshin_subsidise_family_farms_desc:0 "Of the many fronts in our war against the megacorporations, one that is often overlooked is that of the agricultural industry. There are seldom few farmers who are not forced to operate under the corporate heel of the wealthy. We must put an end to this practice.\n\nWe will attempt to counter corporate dominance over agriculture with extensive subsidies for independent, family run farms. By decentralizing the industry, we lay the groundwork for demonopolizing the most basic of our country's needs: food for the masses."
 
 NOV_shukshin_in_line_with_the_rose:0 "In Line with the Rose"

For Russia to be geopolitically weaker than Italy is a humiliating reality and one that the Federation is not willing to abide by. Unlike our old friends in England and what remains of France, the Russian Federation can project its influence across a considerable portion of Eurasia and reassert itself as a global player on the international stage once more.\n\nIt will take time and effort for Russia to be able to reclaim its title as Great Power, something not easily achieved in the near future.

This will not be the end of the struggle in Karelia however, as we must now connect the region with an administration it has been detached from for decades.\n\nWe will refit and fund the existing Murmansk railway to not only connect the new Oblasts to existing infrastructure but to give a central way to coordinate supply in the cold, sparsely developed piece of our nation. While this is only a start, it sets the stage for future infrastructure in Karelia to bring the region up to speed with the rest of our Federation."

A bold new agenda has been laid out to take the Federation's greatness to new heights: looking to the Russian economy to further strengthen its dominance over Eurasia, and gazing up towards the stars to give Russia a space program of its own."

This is where the cold tapestry of the Silvoki first began to crumble with the president Shukshin coming out on top of the race. After a great and long struggle the men of our Federation crossed the Urals and finally unified Russia under the banner of §WWhite§!, §MBlue§!, and §RRed§!.\n\nNow we must continue this dream and still hold the torch high above the oligarchs and corrupt.

We now must usher in a new era of small business.\n\nRussians everywhere will be able to create their own piece of the economic pie with government subsidies towards them and financial aid. The people will have themselves not only successful businesses independent of corporate oversight, but healthy competition and will be able to stimulate the economy firsthand as never before."

 NOV_federal_insurance_act_desc:0 "We shall create an Act that provides general insurance for the wellbeing of the Russian People. The privatization of healthcare has led to nothing but the exploitation of our own citizen's wellbeing for profit and benefited large corporations at their expense. Of course, this does expand our budget considerably and may lead to a heavier strain on the economy.\n\nMedical costs like dental work, yearly examinations, and optometry alongside other forms of basic care will be included as a basic right for all citizens under our flag.

While not only providing renewed prestige to Moscow, its construction will benefit the education of the Federation's youths, and help to attract young Russians to the city.

However, with the winds of change sweeping our Federation, we will lead our nation into becoming a paradise for the working man. Workers shall have strong, strictly enforced protections, incomparable to any other country across Eurasia.\n\nAs a result of our policy, we can expect immigration to Russia to skyrocket. Our nation will become a worker's utopia as thousands flock to our urban centers seeking employment in every sector which calls for the laborer's efforts.

After the last war West Russia has been almost entirely destroyed, but now with life returned to normal we must bring the country forward in time and shake off the specter of nazism haunting it.

Our eastern domain has a vast amount of untapped natural resources and industrial potential that cannot be neglected.

One such avenue is getting nations in a free trade zone with Russia at the lead. Very few nations hold the vast amount of natural resources that we have, and their needs can be more than fulfilled by the vastness of our lands.\n\nWe shall therefore establish the Russian Free Trade Area and attempt to diplomatically gain support of other nations all through Eurasia to further economic interests and to foster a positive relationship among equals.

We border a wide variety of nations from the Central Asian states to the Middle Eastern nations and now that we stand unified, we will move to rebuild our own sphere of influence to rival that of the Einheitspakt and the Co-Prosperity Sphere.\n\nWe will do so by covertly funding factions in these countries that favour us and give them reasonable incentive to come to our side over that of the Nazis or the Japanese. Bit by bit we will lay the groundwork for our future ascension to a global superpower. But first, we must secure our own backyard."

Of course, Titan is not willing to do this solely for the good of Russia.

In what once was the Komi Republic, there resides a group of scientists dedicated to a cult of progress, once known as the socialist Ultravisionary movement.\n\nSome say that it will be a waste of time to hear out these people, owing to their odd political views. Inviting them to advise our research and technological development board will be a political gamble as we have yet to see their theories bear fruit, but failure to work with them would deny ourselves a great resource we have for the taking: knowledge."

We have already sent out so much money to other projects and social services, so why hesitate to extend those same funds to the space program?\n\nAlthough this may be seen as a vanity project by our detractors, for others it is what will bring Russia back onto the world stage. In order for us to truly reclaim the title of “Fourth Power” we must do what very few nations have done. We must touch the stars and we need the funding to get us there."

This technological feat will not be without its costs, of course, but the price attached to safe takeoff cannot be too high. With the completion of our method of lifting Russia into space we are one step closer to a manned celestial excursion."

Due to our lack of experience or designs on the scale that the Americans have, and our friendly relations with the US, it only makes sense that in the pursuit of further cooperation between the two eagles they would lend us the blueprints needed for space travel.\n\nThis is by no means an admittance of failure on the Federation's part. This gives us a better opportunity to develop other fields over that of the design stage, as well true, field tested designs assured of success. Truly it is emblematic of our newfound friends and place on the global stage."

With this step, Russia as a nation has reached for the stars and firmly brought them into its grasp as the ambitions of the Federation leave behind the stratosphere in place of the interstellar stratum.

Though it may be the youngest, we will be the ones leading the brave new world that is the 21st century!"

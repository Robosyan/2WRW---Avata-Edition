 NOV_Koyanto:0 "Koyanto"
 POLITICS_NOV_Koyanto_DESC:0 "Koyanto (born Vladimir Vladimirovich Kosygin) has been far away from any and all eyes of the Russian governments. He watched as the government in Novosibirsk held ticker tape parades about the president and enacted sweeping land reform as his own people starved and withered away. Koyanto became an advocate for the Koryak people during this time, hoping to make known the plight of his people.\n\nAs his advocacy and artistry fell on deaf ears, Koyanto grew angrier. Staging a mass demonstration with those of his village at a Russian naval base in Kamchatka, he roused a few thousand of his people into action. Achieving victory in the protests, local officials made a deal with Koyanto to send them medical supplies and food to help them survive the harsh winters. The Koryak people celebrated this victory against the unfeeling and uncaring Federation and even cheered on the army as they marched west against the German Reich. His people held their breath as the Federation stalled and weeped when the Federation fell.\n\nAs it all fell apart, Koyanto understood what he must do. Leading his people towards not only independence but self-sufficiency, the Koryak people will never go hungry again. While the Federation fights itself, Koyanto couldn't care less for whomever takes charge. He’s learned the lessons of the past and will never repeat them again."

 POLITICS_NOV_Rytgev_Rytkheu_DESC:0 "Rytgev Rytkheu, known to the Russian authorities as Yuri Sergeyevich Rytkheu, was born of Chukchi blood in 1930 to a family of trappers and hunters in the far eastern territory of Uelen, at the edge of where Russia's borders ended and the borders of Alaska began. Rytkheu aspired to become a writer and hoped to study in Leningrad, but with poverty and the ill-fated Second World War, he was forced to cope with the anarchy the Germans had caused in the Far East.\n\nWith a reunified Russia came both a return of Russian authority to the area and opportunity for Rytkheu. His dreams to become a writer had never quite left him, and new educational initiatives by Shukshin to promote minority cultures proved bountiful as Rytkheu scored opportunities to write in his own language and even translate Russian cultural works into Chukchi. Rytkheu had achieved his dream whilst fulfilling the proliferation of his language and his culture throughout Russia.\n\nWith the fall of Shukhsin following the defeat against the Germans, the Chukshi people are once more left at the periphery of the chaos. Always a forgotten people, Rytgev Rytkheu has been forced to ensure his people's freedom, this time permanently. Instead of clinging to survival and disappointing book sales, Rytkheu clings to a home to call their own, independent of Russian influence."
 
 NOV_Vladimir_Kibardin:0 "Vladimir Kibardin"
 POLITICS_NOV_Vladimir_Kibardin_DESC:0 "To inspire a belief in men, one must have a cause to fight for.\n\nFor Vladimir Kibardin, that cause was the salvation of Russia. Fighting alongside the Vozhd in Magadan during the brutal Smuta, he held firm as a believer in the traditional yet pragmatic fascism fought for by the anti-German sect of the RFP. An ever loyal servant of Matkovsky, Kibardin believed that his innovative political mind and charisma was enough to lead Russia into a new age. He was wrong.\n\nThe Vozhd fell to his own demons in the reformists and the parasites as they twisted and subverted his power. Magadan fell, and with it any hope of salvation for the Russian people. The weakness of the Shukshin administration and the democracy that followed split the dying Russian bear into pieces once more, just as Kibardin had foreseen. He waited, biding his time in the shadows, gathering the last true sons of Russia for one last dying grasp at Destiny.\n\nThe destiny of Russia was to be strong and to make her enemies beg for salvation and mercy. Only under Kibardin is there hope for that future. Now, entrenched as the new leader of the RFP in Magadan where the man he once idolized begged for the help of the American and the mercenary, he will rule. It is he who will not stray from the path. It is he who will be the guiding light for Russia. And where he walks, Magadan will follow."
 
 NOV_Matvey_Innokentevich_Amagaev:0 "Matvey Innokent'evich Amagaev"
 POLITICS_NOV_Matvey_Innokentevich_Amagaev_DESC:0 "Sometimes, life is about being at the right place at the right time.\n\nFor Matevy Innokentyevich Amagaev, being chosen as the deputy chairman of the Buryat Committee in 1921 was due to sheer happenstance. His background as a member of the Buryat people and in the teacher’s institute helped his candidacy dearly as he worked to improve relations between the Soviet Union and the Buryat people alongside developing agricultural and administrative programs. As the Soviet Union rose and fell, it was Matvey’s brilliance and unorthodox approach to politics that kept him at the forefront of Buryatia's local policy and their place within the Union. Matvey's role in government persisted even during the collapse as he did what he could to better the lives of the common man in the midst of war and famine. When the Federation rose from the ashes of the Union, hope returned for a better Russia.\n\nSuch hope was misplaced.\n\nNow, divided and broken, the Federation has been lost to the ashes and chaos of defeat and there is no one left to protect the Buryat people. Though his introduction into politics was unexpected, the crucible of chaos can forge a man into what he must become. The Buryat people need a leader for the first time in ages. And Matvey Innokentyevich Amagaev must become that leader, lest his fate be the same as the Russia of old."
 
 POLITICS_NOV_Anatoly_Marchenko_DESC:0 "Marchenko was born to humble roots. Son to an illiterate locomotive operator and a train station janitor, Marchenko was forced to endure the horrors of the Second World War as a child of Novosibirsk Oblast. As he rose to adulthood, the hardships of a Russia splintered and broken were settling in. Food was scarce as people became more and more desperate. Marchenko became a slave to the oil fields during this time. Everything would change when Shukshin reunified the nation.\n\nShukshin brought hope, and with that spark, Merchenko sought to fight the oligarchs that pressed down on him and his fellow man. Diving headlong into the Federation's political scene, Marchenko brought pen to paper and became a fierce critic of the unjust conditions present in the newly reunified Federation, eventually being elected to the Duma. Although it made him grave enemies, Marchenko lived a life fit to purpose and without weight on his conscience.\n\nThe defeat of the Federation proved a devastating blow. Marchenko had been fighting his whole life in some way. First to survive, then against the hated oligarch. With all of his allies dead, imprisoned, or about to be either of the two, Marchenko fled with the rest of the Duma to Tomsk, carrying the last vestiges of Russian democracy with him. With what little he could stuff into a briefcase, his fight would continue."
 
 NOV_Georgiy_Basharin:0 "Georgiy Basharin"
 POLITICS_NOV_Georgiy_Basharin_DESC:0 "When the Soviet Union collapsed, Georgiy Basharin became the face of the Yakut people, representing their struggle and perseverance for independence and life in a cold, darkened land. The Russian anarchy did not bend him, nor did it break the spirit of the Yakut people. Neither did the oligarchs, with their greed hanging over the land like a plague, seeping into the mines and the cold searching for diamonds and treasures beyond their wildest dreams. For a time, Georgiy felt lost in a world where warlords with dreams of unification and oppression in equal numbers roamed the Russian tundra.\n\nWhen the Federation came, he gladly began working alongside them for the betterment of all people, not just the Yakut. But just as in the days of the Soviet Union, darkness came across the land. It shattered hope, breaking the spirits of men and sent dreams of a better future to oblivion itself. Now, Basharin finds himself alone in leading his people once more, but much has changed. New faces, new corporations, and new interests in his land have drained more and more out of an older man. Once a beacon of light, all that exists now of the Yakut and Basharin is an ember. Yet, even an ember can light a flame, and it is the hope of Yakutia that one day, a better world for the people of Siberia can come and deliver on the dream that was once promised to them all."
 
 POLITICS_NOV_Amet_khan_Sultan_DESC:0 "Born in the fires of revolution engulfing southern Crimea in 1920, Amet-khan was born for the sky. During the Great Patriotic War, he was laconically called the "Master of Ramming" for smashing his Yak-7B into a German reconnaissance bomber. With defeat after defeat, Amet-khan was forced away from his homeland and deep into the tundras of the frozen far east.\n\nHere he found the Russian Federation in the city of Novosibirsk with a fellow pilot at the helm. However, upon fully understanding the deep corporate interests that had driven their talons deep into the Russian people, Sultan decided to join the opposition under Shukshin. The airman and the writer found comfort in more liberal and anti corporate ideals. Both wished to save Russia from a new type of dictatorship and create a truly free federation of equals. When the All Russian People’s Party won the 1971 election, there was a wave flowing through the entire country: a feeling of hope and wonder, and a genuine yearning for the beauty the future held.\n\nIt all collapsed when the war was lost. Sultan hopes to keep the mantle of a truly democratic Russia, but with many now fighting over scraps like they once did merely half a decade ago, that hope recedes. Amet-Kahn will lead his flock into a democratic future either by carrot or by crook, and Russia will either rise into the heights or it shall fall into the pit of despair."
 
 NOV_Ogdo_Aksyonova:0 "Ogdo Aksyonova"
 POLITICS_NOV_Ogdo_Aksyonova_DESC:0 "Siberia is often seen as a desolate, immaterial place filled with snow and endless winter to those ignorant to Russia’s secrets. Life has flourished there, and has remained in spite of all hardships. Ogdo Aksyonova was born in the remote region as a reindeer herder, raised and taught by her parents. But her true passions were the written word, poetry and politics.\n\nWhen the Federation came to Siberia, Ogdo jumped at the opportunity and traveled to the west to learn of new places and new people and to spread the word of her own homeland and its beauty. What she found in the Federation was entirely different to her own understanding of the world, a burgeoning land full of love and passion for its people. Inspired, she channeled the very cold of the Siberian winter into her poetry, her speeches, and stoked a fire in those who would listen: the fire of a warm home.\n\nBut it was not meant to last. As the German armies shattered a carefully laid dream, she returned home to Taymyria, where she learned that for the lives of those she had left behind, not much had changed at all. Determined not to let the dream of something that had almost changed the existence of Russia fade away, Ogdo took leadership of her homeland, and kept within her heart the hope of a brighter future for all. If not for Russia, then at least for Taymyria."

 POLITICS_NOV_Alitet_Nemtushkin_DESC:0 "It is often said that poets are men who mask their feelings with smiles, for they have seen the end of all stories.\n\nAliet Nemtushkin came to the Federation with dreams and passion, for he was a man of love and knowledge. A statesman who had both care and commitment for his people, the Evenik wished to see themselves represented and cared for within the grand halls of Novosibirsk. As he spoke and fought for those who had no voice for themselves, whispering tales of sorrow and joy, more and more eyes glanced at this strange and delightful man. For a time, it seemed as though his work and activism would be enough to create a future that he had dreamed of, lifting away another malady from the land. But this future would not come to be, as from the west came a darkness as fierce and terrifying as children's tales of monsters in the dark. And with the coming of the dark, the light slowly and surely faded away, becoming nothing but a memory set upon the page.\n\nBut what would become of the Evenik? What would their future be in another endless night? Aliet Nemtushkin was unsure, but as one who had fought for their rights, championed their beliefs, and put their dreams onto the pen and in word, why not him? He may have seen the end of the Federation, witnessed its grandness and its folly, but the story of his own kind was not yet over.\n\nIt had yet to be written at all."

 POLITICS_NOV_Valery_Chaptynov_DESC:0 "Born in 1945, and only knowing a Russia that had been shattered and broken under the yolk of the Germans, Valery Ivanovich Chaptynov desired only one thing: a homeland for the Altai people. Forgotten under first the Russian Empire, then the Soviet Union, Chaptynov fought so that the Federation would not be the third Russian government to ignore the voices of the Altai, the third to turn a blind eye to their calls for autonomy and self governance. Through hard work and perseverance, Valery climbed his way to the Duma, becoming the only representative for the Altai people under the newly proclaimed Federation. There, he argued not just for the will and the future of the people who lived in the Altai lands, but for his own kindred.\n\nIn the short life of the Duma, Valery pushed for more rights and more autonomy for the Altai, but such ambitions fell short, shot out of the air before the bird had even launched into the sky. It was the German tide that swept away the Federation, leaving Russia in a state of decay and darkness once more, broken of all hope. But for the Altai and Valery, a light shines ever brighter: a light of freedom and self determination. Now, it is Valery’s turn to forge a new destiny for his people, not as a representative of a foreign government but a leader of his people in a time of chaos. For if he fails, there will be no future for the Altai, nor himself."
 
 NOV_Megacorporation_Troika:0 "Megacorporation Troika"
 POLITICS_NOV_Megacorporation_Troika_DESC:0 "Before the war began, the three megacorporations of Novosibirsk were some of the most highly valued companies in the world. When Shukshin came to power, he tried everything he could to limit the powers of such influential figures on the Russian economy to the point where the only thing they could effectively do was submit to the demands of the president and, even worse, give up their hard-earned profits to the government for taxes. It was an unfair deal for those who worked so hard to get where they were.\n\nAs the war began, the megacorporations obeyed Shukshin's orders, building a vast network of factories and logistical hubs. The entire city of Novosibirsk had been nothing more than a backwater before the extravagant wealth of Feniks, Sibir, and Titan made the city a center of industrialization. By the time the Germans had routed the last Russian army, Novosibirsk was relatively intact and ripe for the megacorporations to sink their claws into once more.\n\nNow, the war has ended in Russia's defeat. Shukshin is gone, and with him went all of the so-called "rights of man". The three megacorporations have established themselves as the rightful rulers of what's left of Novosibirsk. Democracy has failed in Russia yet again, and it is up to the corporations of Novosibirsk to bring the people the order and stability they so crave. And to line their own pockets, while they're at it."
 
 POLITICS_NOV_Alexander_Novikov_DESC:0 "In another time, Alexander Novikov would have marched down the streets of Moscow as a liberator and hero; someone to be remembered. Now he marches only in the cold, carrying the banner of a dead ideology and a dead future. He was once a famed Marshal of the All-Russian Army, the face of a nation that had built itself from nothing, and the leader of Russia in its ultimate struggle against its greatest foe.\n\nYet, all of that had been for naught. The German tide had broken the will of the Russian people, perhaps forever. A specter still haunted Europe, but worse of all, it haunted Russia. His motherland would be confined to a land of specters, dead dreams and beliefs whose impact would only be thought of in memory and never seen. When the Federation collapsed, Norikov took his army east, traveling to Siberia in order to regroup as far away from the German front as he could, finding only shattered lands and chaos before settling and establishing a military government. One of the few successors of the Federation and its dream, Alexander Norikov is not a stupid man. He sees the storm upon the horizon: a second age of dead sons and unending night, another lifetime of scampering civilians and banditry, another era of death and twilight. Alexander Norikov must now live through another storm–another broken Russia–haunted by the ghosts of two dead futures.\n\n"

 POLITICS_NOV_Leonid_Vasilievich_Laptsui_DESC:0 "How does a man come to lead a fragment of a broken dream? For Leonid Vasilievich Laptsui, it began in an editorial office putting together a newspaper for the common man of the Nenets and Yamal people of the Russian far north. When the Federation came, he looked at these Russians with skepticism; how could he not? They had promised care and representation for everyone as part of their democracy, and a federation of equals. The disparate peoples and ethnic groups of Siberia had long known a second class lifestyle, from the days of the old Russian Empire to the Soviet Union. If the Federation would listen, Leonid would bring them what they needed to hear.\n\nAfter he graduated from college, he became a successful author and editor for a newspaper in his district, gaining the prominence to be elected to a governmental office that allowed him to directly improve his people's lives. For a time, it had seemed as if the future of Russia and the Nenet-Yamal peoples would be bright, but even the brightest sun had to set. The Federation was swallowed by darkness, shattering Russia back to where it had been just a decade before. But for Leonid and the Nenets, the fall of the Federation meant something different: the ability to forge one’s own destiny. No longer chained by the wills of Russia, a new democracy would rise from the cinders of the old, one for the people that Mother Russia had left behind."

 POLITICS_NOV_Alexander_Vasilyevich_Filipenko_DESC:0 "Building was one of the few joys Alexander found in life. Though it was his job, he’d had an interest in construction ever since he got his hands on a hammer as a child. After graduating from high-school, he went straight to work, getting himself a position in one of the many industrial sectors. Though he was little more than a construction worker, he helped construct many bridges across the Ob river at record times, not only earning him numerous state-awards, but also much deserved promotions, leading him to go from one man among millions to the secretary of the Khantia-Mansia region.\n\nThis position would not last long, however, as the Federation was plunged into chaos. Soon after, Russia faced its second humiliation in a lifetime in its disastrous loss in the Second West Russian War. Taking it upon himself to secure the lands he had once served, he declared himself the provisional leader of the Khantia-Mansia region. Though the Federation had collapsed under its own weight, Alexander would forever ensure that whatever lands he controlled would not suffer the same end.\n\nHe did this not because he wanted to be remembered as some great leader or the man who saved Russia. He did it because it was what he had always done. He would rebuild his beloved nation piece by piece, no matter how long it took to put it all back together."

Anatoly would be different; he would bring new blood to Russia. Anatoly never got to witness the failure of the Union, nor was he forced to cope with the pains of the catastrophic devastation that followed. Graduating from the Tomsk University of Accounting, he signed up with the Russian Armed Forces to help in the war effort against the German Reich in a move that would change his life.\n\nAfter the humiliating loss against the Reich, he rounded up as many Udmurts as he could find and began his own exodus through Russian lands to save them from the barbaric German army and eventually leading them to the city of Beloretsk. Throughout the journey, the Udmurts grew to respect and admire Anatoly and by the time they reached their safe haven, he was hailed as a president. Anatoly humbly accepted, promising to use his military knowledge to guarantee their security and his education to bring them prosperity.\n\nNow with all the resources the Idel-Urals has to offer, he has begun harboring as many refugees as his borders can sustain, and negotiating with the disparate parties in his lands to the best of his abilities in the hopes that one day Russia may rise from the ashes once more; not as a product of hatred, but out of love for the people."

 POLITICS_NOV_Mongush_Kenin_Lopsan_DESC:0 "Though his childhood was average for his people, Mongush's decades of adulthood became a legacy of resistance. He was a teacher of the Tuvan language and the culturally significant shamanism which the Soviet Union had attempted to wipe from existence in fear that it would eventually become an organized religion. Though such a practice came with the sentence of serving in a Siberian gulag, Mongush was one of the very few who managed to hide from the prying eyes of the NKVD. He spent most of his life under the dictatorial state writing anti-comminist literature, not simply because he perceived communism as a failed ideology, but because of what it had done to his family.\n\nAfter the death of the Soviet Union, Mongush would live a simple life once more in Tuva, raising a small family and keeping to his humble life. Yet, despite the fact that Tuva was for the most part untouched by the new Federation, its collapse left many power-vacuums throughout the vast lands of Russia. One of these power-vacuums would appear among the steppes of Tuva.\n\nThis would prompt the Tuvan people to declare their independence, attempting to be more than just a simple province; a unique nation, one which would forever remain independent. Through a vote among the Tuvan people, Mongush was chosen as their leader. Now it was up to him to ensure that his people stood the test of time, as they always had before."

The first collapse he had witnessed when he was very young, his family being forced to scrape by beneath the dark gloom of the Russian anarchy. When he was older, he decided to move to Novosibirsk in the hopes of finding work to support his family.\n\nThere, he worked in a local factory in the abysmal conditions the corporations had created for their workers. Undeterred, Viktor Orlov began organizing the workers into a union in order to protect their interests. While the corporations successfully curtailed his efforts, he began to make a name for himself as a moderate socialist and managed to secure a job at the agricultural ministry in the Federation, working tirelessly to help promote the interests of the peasantry. Yet all his efforts came crashing down as an inferno swept across the west.\n\nWith the Federation crumbling around him, Viktor returned to his family in Khakassia. With the Russian state imploding for the second time in his life, he knew that for his people to find the peace they sought so desperately, they would need to break away from Russia. Viktor is now ready to chart Khakassia's own path, free from the influence of Russia's failures and corporations, towards a prosperous future."

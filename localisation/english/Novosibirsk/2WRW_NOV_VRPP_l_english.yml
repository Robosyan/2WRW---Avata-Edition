 NOV_the_primakov_presidency:0 "The Primakov Presidency"
 NOV_the_primakov_presidency_desc:0 "Despite what §BShukshin§! and his §Bclique of his idealists§! may think; despite what the §Mradical youths§! and §Mstudents§! on the streets may say; despite what the resurgent §xNarodnik§! terrorists may do, they cannot change the truth: Russia owes its prosperity, owes its sovereignty, owes it freedom, to the corporations. Without Sibir's wheat, Feniks' guns, or Titan's innovation, the German heel would've crushed our great nation forever.\n\nFortunately, this is a fact the silent majority of hard-working Russians understand. Now, having given Yevgeny Primakov and his All-Russian Patriotic Party the mandate to rule, they will be silent no more. By fully embracing the free market, streamlining Russia's bloated bureaucracy, and preventing dangerous radicals from destroying our capitalist system, the old order that made our country great will return.\n\nAnd only enemies of Russia will have any reason to complain."

 NOV_getting_our_hands_dirty:0 "Getting our Hands Dirty"
 NOV_getting_our_hands_dirty_desc:0 "In the aftermath of the most recent election, the £GFX_NOV_VRPP_Icon §gVRPP§! now stands in a position which enables us to finally pursue our deepest goals. With Primakov at our head, we can begin the first steps of forging a new and improved destiny for the Russian Federation, one sustained by the power and prosperity of the megacorporations and controlled by the absolute power of the state.\n\nThe path ahead is clear, and even now the first steps are being taken. The Duma will bow, the courts will submit, and the people will be properly informed by a state media designed for “responsibility” and “truthfulness”. And when we're done we will look upon our work with pride, as we will have finally solidified our power against all internal opposition and saved Russia from its internal divisions."

 NOV_our_generous_benefactors:0 "Our Generous Benefactors"
 NOV_our_generous_benefactors_desc:0 "Through the many years of turmoil the Federation went through, there was always one group to guide us through the worst of every storm: The §gSiloviki§!. These massive businesses have sacrificed so much for Russia, only to have been attacked by the likes of §BShukshin§! and his fellow posse of fools who aimed to destroy the Federation's greatest heroes in an attempt to elevate the wealth of the everyday man.\n\nThis was an absolutely unforgivable act, for if anyone deserves the vast wealth and resources of Russia, it's those that risked everything for its defense. Our first moves will be to elevate their power as a reward for their generous acts toward the advancement of Russia, creating a powerful ally in the process that will remain loyal throughout our pursuit of reform."

 NOV_lucrative_business_opportunities:0 "Lucrative Business Opportunities"
 NOV_lucrative_business_opportunities_desc:0 "Ensuring the loyalty of such powerful entities like those of the megacorporations will require some very enticing concessions, and we will offer them just that. The vast expanses of the Federation harbor a cornucopia of natural resources and untapped consumer markets, which offer endless opportunities to the Siloviki, provided we ensure that smaller businesses cease to offer anything resembling competition.\n\nOffering the megacorporations such lucrative opportunities will further increase their loyalty, while increasing our own wealth in the process. The people may protest, especially those that own private businesses. But we must sweep them aside to ensure the fulfillment of our modernization."

 NOV_tax_breaks:0 "Tax Breaks"
 NOV_tax_breaks_desc:0 "One of the primary weapons those who opposed the Siloviki have used was the ability to tax them into the red. Yet, after having sacrificed so much for the Federation, who can claim that they deserve such undeserved and harsh restrictions placed onto them? It's time we undo the tyrannical acts of our predecessors.\n\nNot only will we lift the existing taxes, but we will exempt them from most of the normal ones as well. In doing so, we can begin to further elevate the wealth of the megacorporations while also gradually improving the benefits of our partnership for continued economic growth."

 NOV_repealing_the_environmental_protection_act:0 "Repeal the Environmental Protection Act"
 NOV_repealing_the_environmental_protection_act_desc:0 "For four long years, Russia's potential has been capped by those who preach the supposed threats of pollution, a message that many sadly support. The previous administration may not have been willing to push the limits of our industrial capability, but we will not dare put restraints on the pursuit of prosperity.\n\nWe will need to repeal these regulations and laws, while silencing the activist groups who are blind to the truth of our cause. With this act our corporate partners will be more loyal than ever, as they will no longer be shackled by the cries of the unenlightened commoner."

 NOV_controlling_the_media:0 "Controlling the Media"
 NOV_controlling_the_media_desc:0 "As we plan our future, it has become clear that the biggest obstacle we will face is the battlefield of public opinion. This battleground is dominated by the vipers of the so-called “free press”, ignorant scoundrels who spread their own message of the truth. If we want to secure our position, we must ensure that these enemies of the nation are rooted out.\n\nIn their place, we will create a media outlet that will spread the only responsible version of the truth. It will let the world know of our mission for economic growth and stability, swaying the citizens of our nation to support us in our practices and methods. From it, we will ensure many years of comfortable support, a perfect recipe for stability. After all, doesn't everyone want peace and quiet?"

 NOV_steal_from_the_states:0 "Steal from the States"
 NOV_steal_from_the_states_desc:0 "Although we may not be able to have a concrete hold on Russian media just yet, there's plenty of opportunity for profit in the meantime. More specifically, we can get into contact with some of our more...shady friends in order to reap the benefits from the far more experienced and profitable entertainment industry of The United States.\n\nIf we can successfully use this new resource, the benefits would be numerous. In short, we'll be able to kill two birds with one stone by simultaneously providing cheap entertainment while at the same time using the profit for our own uses. The Russian people will benefit from our endeavors, in the long run."

 NOV_pinch_from_the_past:0 "Pinch from the Past"
 NOV_pinch_from_the_past_desc:0 "If we are to truly profit from the developing a homegrown Russian entertainment industry, we mustn't corrupt it with outside influence that doesn't reflect our culture and values. Although the costs may be high, the possibility of a vastly profitable industry under our control is too big of an opportunity to pass up.\n\nAlready, the first investments and plans are being made. Hundreds of channels with a variety of topics that concentrate on the aspects of the nation, its history, and its government. Of course, we will maintain the right to have the final say in the publishing and display of such topics, for we wouldn't want any disinformation being spread."

 NOV_cant_protest_the_unknown:0 "Can't Protest the Unknown"
 NOV_cant_protest_the_unknown_desc:0 "Our efforts to exert our influence and solidify our grip over Russian media have begun to bear fruit. Even now, our network is among the most popular in the nation. Even in neighboring nations, our broadcasts have begun to gain traction. However, the primary goal is not to simply keep the people content with bread and circuses, but to create a veil that separates the citizen from the state.\n\nIn this pursuit, we have begun to gain ground. Already, the approval ratings of President Primakov have begun to show signs of improving. Regardless of how accurate our message is in the short-term, we go onward knowing that the people wouldn't be capable of understanding our true goals anyway."

 NOV_securing_our_hold:0 "Securing our Hold"
 NOV_securing_our_hold_desc:0 "After months of struggle and backdoor dealings, we now find ourselves in a position more secure than ever before. With the backing of the Siloviki as well as direct control over the flow of information to the people, we can now begin to pursue our final goal: absolute power over the Federation.\n\nThis day has been in the making for a long time, as all who doubted us now stand in awe of our newfound power. Soon, the Duma and courts will no longer be an obstruction to our ambition, and Russia's destiny will be at the mercy of Primakov's will. A shining new era of economic growth, social stability, and military prowess awaits Russia!"

 NOV_securing_the_courts:0 "Securing the Courts"
 NOV_securing_the_courts_desc:0 "Of the few remaining threats that still continue to stand in our way, few pose as much of a threat to our political domination as much as massive legal entities such as the Supreme Court and the geriatric fools within. Although it would initially seem as though such a problem can't be dealt with, a few well placed bribes and blackmailing could easily ensure its continued 'objectivity'.\n\nWith yet another piece on the board turning to our side, we will have finally crossed the point of no return. Primakov and the £GFX_NOV_VRPP_Icon §gVRPP§! inch ever closer to the goal of a new, controlled democracy, and our opponents will be forced to watch as we burn away all of their work. And from it's ashes, Primakov shall create a truly strong state."

 NOV_bribe_those_who_cooperate:0 "Bribe those who Cooperate..."
 NOV_bribe_those_who_cooperate_desc:0 "Many see those in the Supreme Court as being virtuous individuals that are immune to what most decry as “corruption” and “bribery”. Although there are certainly those who insist on sticking to their virtues in the hopes of maintaining a healthy public image, there are far more who can't help but salivate at the idea of further lining their pockets.\n\nA significant pile of cash has been compiled to achieve exactly that. Several candidates for this are lined up, and with their support our last challenger will slowly begin to crumble, paving the way for the ultimate goal."

 NOV_blackmail_those_who_do_not:0 "...Blackmail those who Protest"
 NOV_blackmail_those_who_do_not_desc:0 "Although there's certainly a large majority whose loyalty is purchasable, there's unfortunately still a group who continue to resist our generous offerings. Luckily, this group is far from invulnerable. Our agents have compiled a long list of potentially...career ending crimes committed by our opponents.\n\nAlthough some of these claims aren't exactly true, we can at least guarantee almost all remaining opposition will no longer be so adamantly against our reforms. Those that remain will find themselves in a particularly unfortunate situation, as their voices are drowned out by our united voice, from the airwaves to the printing press."

 NOV_the_cards_are_stacked:0 "The Cards are Stacked"
 NOV_the_cards_are_stacked_desc:0 "At long last, we are nearing the end of the road. Our corporate allies are stronger than ever, as the media of the nation keeps the people content and dispenses the only truth they need to know. As the Supreme Court bends to our will, many within the £GFX_NOV_VRPP_Icon §gVRPP§ now propose that we finally finish off the last pieces on the board.\n\nTwo final objectives must now be accomplished. First, Primakov has pointed out the potential in the £NOV_RAPP_Icon §BRAPP§! if they were to be swayed towards our direction. Lastly, we need to earn the genuine goodwill of the people, so that we may purge any remaining discontent."

 NOV_friends_in_the_rapp:0 "Friends in the RAPP"
 NOV_friends_in_the_rapp_desc:0 "Although there's plenty among the Duma that are under our thumb, the advantage we possess isn't nearly as large as it should or could be. Eyeing up our potential targets, the most vulnerable are those of the £NOV_RAPP_Icon §BRAPP§!, who may be open to switching their allegiance and joining our cause.\n\nWith an equal amount of blades and rubles, as well as a few attacks from our corporate and media allies in the right pressure points, it would be all we need to ensure yet another political victory in the Duma."

 NOV_convince_them:0 "Convince Them"
 NOV_convince_them_desc:0 "Just like the Supreme Court, there are many who are willing to change their tune with only a suitcase full of cash. Although some may cost more than others, the price is surely worth the act of putting the symbolic nail in the coffin of this unreliable democracy of Shukshin's.\n\nAs the final walls of opposition crumble, the long term goals of Primakov and the £GFX_NOV_VRPP_Icon §gVRPP§! inch ever closer to reality. Soon, the democracy of maladroits will be transformed into the strong authority that the Federation so desperately needs."

 NOV_threaten_them:0 "Threaten Them"
 NOV_threaten_them_desc:0 "Although money is certainly a very alluring thing, it's far from the most effective motivator. Of all human emotion, fear is by far the strongest. With our reach and power, fear is exactly what we shall distribute, and we shall let them know what will happen if they refuse our generous offerings.\n\nJust as we “swayed” our political opponents in the past, the ever-present danger of a suspicious death or disappearance should their political opinions divert from those of the £GFX_NOV_VRPP_Icon §gVRPP§! will keep our new friends in line."

 NOV_if_you_stay_in_line_your_good:0 "If You Stay in Line, You'll Be Fine"
 NOV_if_you_stay_in_line_your_good_desc:0 "With the Duma effectively under our control, it's about time we ensure that this control becomes total. Our power has increased so much in recent times that we can now ensure all of our opponents either stay in line, or are removed from the board.\n\nThe final days of the dream that the people called democracy are nearing. With the remaining organs of government submitting to Primakov's authority, and the curtains that separate the world from us closing ever more, our success is all but assured."

 NOV_friends_of_the_common_folk:0 "Friends of the Common Folk"
 NOV_friends_of_the_common_folk_desc:0 "Although we may achieve dominance over the political functions of the state, that state is propped up by the masses underneath it. In other words, power is meaningless without a group to validate it. President Primakov has realized this, and now his priorities will have to shift from the great game of politics to convincing the great people of Russia of his good intentions and affection for them.\n\nThrough media appearances painting him as a man of the people, to adjusting taxes and social programs so that the £GFX_NOV_VRPP_Icon §gVRPP§! is painted in the most positive of images, the people will learn to love and respect us. If they do not... we will ensure they will not cause trouble."

 NOV_token_tax_reforms:0 "Token Tax Reforms"
 NOV_token_tax_reforms_desc:0 "Earning the goodwill of the people can be accomplished with a surprisingly small amount of effort. Although there are several things we could do, Primakov has insisted on getting the most out of a small amount of effort. After all, we wouldn't want to give away too much state funds for base appeasement.\n\nThe solution? Mild tax cuts for working people. Of course, the negative effects of such taxes won't apply to members of the £GFX_NOV_VRPP_Icon §gVRPP§! or our allies, and we won't lose much money in the process. However, those of the lower and middle classes will celebrate such “reforms”, and we'll gain some much-desired gratitude from them."

 NOV_cut_unnecessary_social_spending:0 "Cut Unnecessary Social Spending"
 NOV_cut_unnecessary_social_spending_desc:0 "A new proposal has come to the desk of President Primakov, detailing a new option for gaining public approval. It describes a possible plan that would not only achieve a successful public relations victory, but could also fill our pockets in the process.\n\nWe will drastically slash government spending on our social programs, while publicly announcing that such cuts will "end welfare fraud". With our control over the media, they will celebrate the end of these supposed fraudsters, while we save hundreds of millions of rubles on unnecessary handouts."

 NOV_the_people_pacified:0 "The People, Pacified"
 NOV_the_people_pacified_desc:0 "Although the intellectuals and progressives will continuously attack the government for trivial things like "lack of transparency" or "neo-authoritarianism", what these thinkers claim does not make up for their general impotence. Who else could bring Russia to such heights other than the Patriotic Party? Who else could uplift the Russian people from poverty better than the £GFX_NOV_VRPP_Icon §gVRPP§!? The people won't care about what goes on behind the regime, so long as they, or most of them, reap benefits from the arrangement. Giving people real, tangible benefits will sever the support base of the £GFX_NOV_DSPR_Icon §PDSPR§! and £NOV_RAPP_Icon §BRAPP§!. Let's see how many will come to their next rallies!"

 NOV_a_perfectly_broken_system:0 "A Perfectly Broken System"
 NOV_a_perfectly_broken_system_desc:0 "At long last, the dream of the £GFX_NOV_VRPP_Icon §gVRPP§! has been achieved. The Siloviki are loyal in ways they never were during Pokryshkin's time. The average Russian only knows what he needs to, as our media outlets spread the good word of Primakov's Presidency to all. The people are happy with our prosperity. The bureaucracy of the nation bends to our will, with the few remnants of resistance slowly being swept away.\n\nFinally, our power is now unquestionable. The world decries our actions as tyrannical and layered in corruption, yet they will never understand that Primakov is the only one willing to secure destiny and truly lead Russia in the modern age."

 ### CHARACTERS ###

 NOV_Yevgeny_Primakov: "Yevgeny Primakov"
 POLITICS_YEVGENY_PRIMAKOV_DESC:0 "Yevgeny Primakov believes in power.\n\nHe is not a Nazi, not a raving lunatic, nor a blustering buffoon, but he understands that in the great game of politics, power is vital. The power of guns, of money, of production, of commanding the great behemoths of industry and populace to your whims. That is power.\n\nPower is how men are born, and how men die. As a Jewish person, he felt the jackboot of Nazi power force him to the east, how they killed his family in Kiev. How the will of the Stalinist bureaucracy failed to control the various army factions, and how it led to disaster. How with Yeltsin, in Sverdlovsk, a slightly more efficient stratocracy still failed to unite Russia. Primakov looked upon who did it; the §gSiloviki§!, the capitalistic oligarchical titans of power and industry. Here, in Novosibirsk, power was perfected. The army, the scientists, the agriculturalists, and the industrialists, all holding power and fighting to extract the most efficiency, the most product, out of people and land.\n\nThis was what was needed to win. While Vasiliy Shukshin's government was able to beat back the Russians and curb the excesses of the Siloviki, those excesses are now past them all. In the age of uncertainty, of dangerous reconstruction filled with settler-Nazis, a new focus on Russians and their rights are needed. And Primakov, free of Alexander's scandalous past, is the new face to lead the £GFX_NOV_VRPP_Icon §gVRPP§! and Russia.\n\nNow, he sits at the helm of the §gthree-headed Leviathan§!, whose fangs snap at his face, the great beast of §xthe people§!, who call for self-mutilation or immolation, and their desire to tear Russia apart. It will not be easy, they will try to destroy him. But he will win.\n\nAnd if he ends up being richer, more powerful, than any before him in Russia, who would blame him?"
 NOV_Yuri_Zubakov: "Yuri Zubakov" # This guy is the leader if Primakov gets merk'd
 POLITICS_YURI_ZUBAKOV_DESC:0 "Yuri Zubakov was born in Chita on the 27th of November, 1943, right as the Soviet Union was fully collapsing. As the Nazis swept from the West, the Japanese and their fascist goons swept from the East, taking over Chita with a gaggle of fascists and military strongmen. As such, Zubakov had never known what democracy felt like, only power under a gun, despite all of its pretenses. Oh, how Zubakov knew the power of a gun. In Chita, he became an agent of the military's intelligence services, not to terrorize people, but to manage the affairs of state. A high-level bureaucrat with the lives of many in the palm of his hands, Zubakov knew how to use the tools of state to get his way.\n\nWhen the eagle of Novosibirsk ran through the Far East, he learned of just how powerful the new brokers of might were, these so-called §gSiloviki§!. The power of the megacorporations let them make advancements necessary for this Russian state to destroy its opposition and bring blessed stability to Russia. When Shukshin's §BRAPP§! won the elections, he knew that these reforms they proposed were mere demagoguery. The people? They did not know anything but oafish sloth. Naturally, he joined the new §gAll-Russian Patriotic Party§! to fight these attempts to subvert progress. Even Primakov, the party's new face, was lacking. He was trying to contain a system, but the issue was never that it had excesses, but that Pokryshkin refused to fight the populist menace head-on!\n\nPoor Primakov never saw it coming, or perhaps he did and was too foolish to stop him. Now, even though he was remarkably young, the Siloviki's truest acolyte was in office.\n\nLet these fools try to stop progress and prosperity now."

To make this a reality, he believes the best strategy is to cater to both the United States and the Empire of Japan, so that Russia may reap the benefits of both without throwing its lot in with either.

Rem Viakhirev - a former oil magnate affiliated with Titan - is Primakov's hand-picked man for the position at the head of the treasury, likely due to their shared beliefs in regards to finance.\n\nA ruthless businessman with a short temper, Viakhirev seeks to put control of the economy in the hands of a select group of experts, rather than a load of country bumpkins who barely know how to vote.

 VRPP.1.desc:0 ""Walk me through this again, Silayev," Primakov said as he looked over the spread of forms and graphs on his desk. "This is an awful lot of paperwork to be processed so quickly over... a television station?"\n\nSilayev bounced into a reply, roused by Primakov's hesitation. "Yes, exactly," he slammed a finger into the desk, "Quickly. The public grows ever-more rebellious with their outcry against our administration by the day, the minute. You've seen what these independent news channels have been broadcasting, it gives the public ideas. We need to tame the media before it sparks a goddamn uprising!" He had a quietude to his voice, muted but filled with vigor. "If Titan's last quarter tells us anything, it's that they need something to diversify their holdings. We make a subsidiary company, buy out the competition, and the sheep go back to grazing."\n\nPrimakov held silent for a moment, considering his words. The media remained one of the last vestiges of the country out of their grip, but making a move this quickly could only make the spark of dissent glow brighter.\n\nPrimakov tapped his fingers on the desk rhythmically in thought. "Silayev, you understand if we did this it would have to be done carefully. We cannot just go into this under the assumption the people will automatically fall back in line. How do you plan on accounting for error?"\n\n"There won't be any errors. Everything is in place for this to run like clockwork." Silayev laid out the framework of the station more thoroughly. Primakov had to admit, it had its potential. If it was done correctly, one of the largest thorns in their side would be gone for good. Still, the best laid plans...\n\n"There's one thing you haven't told me, Ivan. Who will be taking point on this project?"\n\nSilayev smirked. "You're looking at its newly appointed CEO."\n\nPrimakov chuckled. "You never fail to impress me Ivan. Your project is approved. Try to save some of the profits for the rest of us." Silayev gave a sly grin and the two shared a glass to their new business venture."

His wife, Yuliya, had taken a comfortable position on the far side of the couch.\n\n"Come quickly, my dear, or we'll miss the show!"\n\nAndre sat down alongside his wife, covering his children in a blanket and reaching for the remote to his new television. With the press of a button, images of many varieties flashed before his eyes until he'd found what he was looking for; A comedic little show with ducks, each one an obvious representation of tyrannical historical figures reduced to nothing more than laughable children's cartoon characters.\n\nAs the intro music began to play, he thought back to the darker days of his own youth, when such a luxury item was practically nonexistent in the backwater village that he once called home. It made him really think about how far his nation had come, from those dark days when he'd rush into abandoned wine cellars just so that he could avoid the ever present threat of the bombs…\n\nNowadays, the only thing he had to worry about was petty politics and working his six-to-four - long but worthwhile hours. He'd heard something about the corporation's plans to reduce wages and extend hours, but he hadn't seen any media coverage on such ridiculous plans at all…\n\nAndre's thoughts drifted back to the screen in front of him, as the duck that was obviously just the old Fuhrer of Germany was electrocuted by the other characters, among them the Federation's own Mikhail Baganov.\n\nThe kids laughed with glee, and he couldn't help but laugh along with them. After all, life was good, and there was no sense in trying to go out looking for trouble in the ever chaotic realm of politics."

 VRPP.3.desc:0 "Vadim Pavlov and Pyotr Nikolaev stepped into the crowded break room in the Sibir factory. It was their lunchtime, something that neither Sibir nor VRPP had the courage to seize from the country's laborers. After all, they bore the brunt of the cacophony of industry, suffered the kaleidoscope of smoke and sparks birthed from manufacturing farm equipment. For some, their lunch break was a time to inhale cheap tar and nicotine from their gritty cigarettes. For these two, it was time to prattle.\n\n"Another day, another shitty shift. Didn't you hear from the manager? To increase productivity, they're going to tighten quota enforcement," Pyotr grumbled. "What's next, armed guards to force us to work on gunpoint?"\n\n"Calm down, Pyotr. It's just inspectors, right?" Vadim said. "It can't be that bad. We're the workers, the ones that actually make the value in this business. Wages don't come out of the Earth after all."\n\nPyotr grew more agitated. "We fought against the Germans to destroy fascism in Russia, and now we're bending over for fascist corporatism bit by bit. Don't you think there's a better choice than allowing the oligarchs to trample over us?" His face began to turn red. "Shukshin was an union-buster and a corporate toadie; he didn't have the bravery to admit that the Federation has always been a dictatorship."\n\n"A dictatorship?" Vadim asked Pyotr.\n\n"A dictatorship of the owning class."\n\nVadim rubbed his eyes. "But the VRPP aren't doing anything wrong! The economy is doing the best it's ever been and without them, we wouldn't have these jobs to feed and house our people. Pyotr, you can't be telling me this bullcrap, especially in the factory you depend-."\n\n"Yes I can, and I will make sure the parasites in charge of this factory know what his employees think of his 'policy change'. Our brothers didn't die in protest to allow oligarchy to triumph again!" Pyotr stomped off to his boss' office, while the other workers stared at him bursting out of the break room like a fish out of water."

 VRPP.4.t:0 "Election Night in Microcosm"
 VRPP.4.desc:0 "It was a frigid night in Moscow, and as the election results had been counted out, the results were revealed to the nation: the VRPP had won, with only a slight edge over their competitors. Soon after, an uproar of noise came from the local tavern - both those devastated and celebrating victory.\n\nDmitry, slightly drunk, finally managed to spew out a coherent sentence; "You... y'know, Primakov is actually the best possible leader... he's gonna give all of us, you know, money and jobs by allowing the corporations to expand!" At this, there was another uproar within the tavern, people shouting both insults and praise at Dmitry, but in response, Anatoly told the room; "Well... the, the socialists, they'll give us more jobs... and better pay, the corporations will exploit us and take our money! Hell... they'll, they'll even maybe kill us too! Remember the days of Pokryshkin?!"\n\nIn response, Dmitry screamed profanities at Anatoly, raving at him how Primakov and the VRPP would save the people of Russia from poverty, reminding them of how all had a job under Pokryshkin... even if some were undesirable. His supporters began fighting with Anatoly's supporters, with those attempting to calm it failing.\n\nFinally, Anatoly managed to yell over the noise, saying "No man whose job is slavery is living happy! They are property in a man's clothing! You... you cannot say that this... that that, is justice! No! It cannot... it cannot be!"\n\nThe tavern, including its owner, began brawling, fists being thrown at all who disagreed, chaos taking over the building. In the rabble, with hundreds of voices yelling and a brawl causing the people's drinks to shatter against the floor, the two who began this, Dmitry and Anatoly, still managed to hold their conversation.\n\n"It is justice! People able to get work... get money, how is it, how is it not justice, 'comrade'!" was barely hearable over the commotion in the tavern, the fight now entirely engulfing the small room, some people knocked onto the floor, bleeding.\n\nBefore long, the room was evacuated by the police, the commotion finally being forced to an end. However, though it had ended, Anatoly couldn't help but feel it was a sign of what was to come - an irreparable divide within Russia that may rip the country apart."

In a matter of moments, his team would go to work, ensuring the engine was well-fitted before sending it to the next part of the manufacturing line. But a loud buzz echoed through the factory, and his countenance fell.\n\nThe PA system boomed throughout the manufacturing facility. "Vadim Mikailovich Pavlov, your presence is requested in the manager's office."\n\nVadim walked slowly towards the office, away from his post. The entire situation was already strange to begin with; he was a productive worker, praised by his boss as diligent and loyal to the company, so why a PA announcement?\n\nHe opened the door to the office, and his body shuddered in fear. The old, overweight manager, a man Vadim had never met in person, stood next to two uniformed soldiers glaring at him with hawk-like eyes. This wasn't a promotion, or a raise. It was an interrogation.\n\nHis manager took a sip from his stainless steel canteen. "Vadim Mikhailovich, sit down. These two gentlemen are from the FSB."\n\nVadim sat down, slowly, perspiration beading on his forehead. "Why me?" he asked. "I'm loyal. I've worked all my life for Sibir, attended every VRPP rally in the city, fought in the Liberation War. I'm not a traitor. I'm not a dissenter.  For God's sake, I'm a patriot!"\n\n"Perhaps," one of the FSB agents said. He flipped open his notepad. "What was your relationship with Pyotr Iosifovich Nikolaev, two weeks prior to his dismissal?""

 VRPP.6.desc:0 "Cigar smoke filled the room, as the humming of lights and the ticking of the clock continued their rhythmic tune. Behind an ornately carved desk in the middle of it all sat President Primakov, organizing a set of papers and reaching for the third cigar of the hour.\n\nAfter all, today was yet another day of business. Some of the corporate executives had sent a few representatives to hold a meeting with the President, one which was 'of utmost importance and concern' for him to partake in. Things needed to be organized, in order, and ready for when they arrive-\n\nThe doors to Primakovs office burst open, with the neatly dressed yet stone faced corporate officials taking their seats at various seats in front his desk. Among the group was Vinogradov, who led the discussion.\n\n"Primakov, let's not clutter up the purpose of this meeting with meaningless introductions. We're here for action, not words."\n\nHe slid a folder over to Primakov, as the latter gave a glare of suspicion. Upon further examination of its contents, it became quite clear why Vinogradov was so intent on avoiding pleasantries. A detailed plan, involving the repealing of past reforms, tax breaks, and further political backroom dealings dotted every line of every page.\n\nVinogradov could tell when he had finished reading, and spoke once more.\n\n"As you can see, our goals are quite…ambitious. However, if their full extent were to ever unveil itself to the general public, we'd be ruined within days. That's where you come in, Primakov."\n\nPrimakov raised his brow, "I truly don't see how I could keep the vultures off of you and your posse. Surely there's something I'm not understanding here."\n\nVinogradov simply smiled.\n\n"It's quite simple. You've got to close the curtains, so to speak, and distract the public with something while we push through the more controversial aspects of our goals."\n\nThe President rose from his seat, sighing as he did so and adjusting the buttons of his suit.\n\n"A distraction? What would you have in mind?"\n\n"Well, why not a little bit of war? Or at the very least, focusing our media outlets on something of the type?""

At this point he was pretty sure the people who arrested him weren't actual police officers, and he could hear his dog, Max, howling from the other end of the building. Bastards got him when he was out for his morning walk. He hoped that his best friend was being treated with at least some dignity and respect.\n\nSuddenly, two men walked into the room, VRPP pins flashing off their ironed suits. As they closed the door and locked it tight, Sergei began to form some idea of what exactly was going on.\n\n"I assume you can tell who we are and who we work for, Sergei," the senior of the two men sneered. His breath reeked of cheap vodka and sausages.\n\nSergei rattled his handcuffs. "I guess you could say so. What do you stooges want? What is the meaning of all this?" He tried desperately not to show it, but Sergei had heard all about the more vulgar members of VRPP. He feared a beating, or worse.\n\n"All we want is your cooperation, Sergei." The thug dropped a file on the table in front of Sergei. "Go ahead, have a look."\n\nInside were images of Sergei doing obscene acts: buying escorts, purchasing narcotics, beating his dog. But Sergei had never done anything of the sort. He loved his wife, and his dog, and hadn't touched any sort of illicit substance since his teen years. A realization slowly dawned on him.\n\n"I feel as if we're all on the same page, Sergei, but let me give you the specifics. You vote our way on the upcoming bill, and we'll keep these photos our little secret, alright?" He winked at Sergei with a tobacco-flecked grin. His friend fiddled around on a keychain and unlocked Sergei's handcuffs. "And now? You're free to go.''\n\nSergei grasped his way up, staring at his old friend all the while. "B-but... Christ, why me?!"\n\n"It's nothing personal, my friend.""

But we've been doing good, okay? There's no reason to swim and struggle against the current."\n\nIvan chose his words carefully. He couldn't push the amicable Shukshinsty too far. Not yet. "Look, no one can deny you guys over at the RAPP have done a lot of good, that's for sure. But do you really want things to stay like this for eternity? Russia can always be better. Stronger. Hold its head higher."\n\n"To be honest? Yes. Things are perfectly fine now Ivan, I don't get why you guys are so up in arms about it. Not to mention, I've got my own reservations about all the Siloviki you guys are-"\n\nIvan cut him off. "For the last time, they aren't our core. We're politicians just like you, Dmitry. The people that support us do so out of their own volition, and we aren't exactly in a position to refuse hefty support."\n\n"It's just..." Dmitry sighed. "I don't have the energy nor conviction to argue about this right now, Ivan. Please, let's just eat."\n\nAs they finished their lunch in relative silence, Ivan stood up, envelope in hand, and securely tucked it into Dmitry's coat pocket. "Keep this with you. Open it when you get home."\n\n"What is this?" Dmitry said, inspecting the inconspicuous package.\n\n"Something that might change your mind."\n\nThat afternoon, Dmitry returned home with an extra 3000 rubles, and the implication that more would be on its way... if he did what he knew they expected him to."

Tonight would be one of those nights, where the evening had started in a local hotel that had been hired for the evening. There was only one person that stood out of the crowd, for all the wrong reasons.\n\nVasily Klopov was dressed in a trench coat covered in dirt, and most noticeably had a black eye on the left side. Without saying a word to anyone in the hotel lobby he headed towards the bar and ordered a drink for himself. He glanced ahead without really focussing on anything, lost in his own thoughts about what had happened before.\n\nOne of his fellow deputies of VRPP, Timofey Makarovich sat down next to him. Unlike Vasiliy he fitted in perfectly with the crowd, wearing a brand new suit imported from overseas. "Vasily," he greeted.\n\nVasily glanced to the side with an intense stare, and went back to drinking. "It's ridiculous. I am just as dedicated to the VRPP as you all are, and yet when I want to help I get this as my reward." He motioned at his eye.\n\nTimofei sighed, "Sometimes, my friend, you just have to follow the party line. There's a hierarchy for a reason, you know, and when you overstep that, it provokes a reaction like that. You just have to let it go for now and properly work your way up the ranks if you want to see your ideas happen."\n\n"Is that what we are then? A nation of big men, handing out big orders and wanting no actual input on how we can do things better?" Vasily huffed. "Do you know how much potential we end up losing out on because of these big leaders with big commands? I believe there was an old Russian term for such men."

The scenery here was incredibly contradictory to the evil that would and had been committed within the walls of this oligarchical fortress. Today, he was brought in for a private meeting with some senior executives. But he was not an architect, or a technician. He was a bloody combination of the two, and he dealt with only one kind of business; death.\n\nHe hadn't always been in the business of murder, and it certainly wasn't something he enjoyed, but the siren's call of money wasn't something that he could just ignore. Every contract was another month of meals. That was his justification for his way of life. After all, the one thing he'd learned about life was that it was kill…or be killed.\n\nHe turned a corner, and stood before a pitch black door of steel. A tiny slot on the side of the door read, 'INSERT KEYCARD HERE'. Ival took the thin plastic rectangle that had been given to him when he'd first accepted the contract, and put it into the contraption. The door in front of him slid open.\n\nOne of the men at the far end of the table spoke first. "Ah, Greetings, Ival. I hope you're in high spirits today, my friend, because today we will be charting a new and better course for our nation."\n\nIval took a quick look around, and saw pictures and diagrams of locations and vehicles. But he immediately recognized the limousine, as well as its esteemed passenger.\n\nPresident Primakov.\n\n"Sir, are you planning what I think you're planning?"\n\nThe man frowned, sitting up straighter in his seat. "It's become clear that our beloved president has been…too troublesome for Russia and her people. We've brought you here to remove the obstruction that is in our way."\n\nHe was going to kill the President. Ival had done many things over the years, but he refused to be a part of this. "Sir, I refuse to be a part of this. You'll have to find someone el-"\n\nThe man opened a briefcase on the table, one which was filled to the brim with more rubles than Ival had ever seen before.\n\nHe sighed, and asked, "When do we start?"\n\nThe man smiled, and gestured over to a nearby board.\n\n"Tomorrow"\n\n"Oh, and may I ask what your name is?""

Primakov was visibly bothered as he barked, "What the hell is this noise? This is a dacha, not a factory, you better get to know that, or I'll find another maid."\n\nIrina's face became paler than snow, "Y-Yes Mr. Primakov. Once more, I apologize, it's just you have been given a gift from a friend." Irina muttered while staring down at the floor.\n\nOvercome with a feeling of worry and curiosity, he ripped the box from her hands and opened it. He was surprised to be met with a simple note. Annoyed, he put on his glasses and began to read. In the large box was a single message that read, 'Dasvidaniya, Yevgeny.'\n\nSuddenly filled with dread, he yelled at Irina, wanting to believe the note was a cruel joke, but she only ran off crying. Primakov rushed to his bedroom and opened his safe, grabbed every ruble he could, and stuffed it into a briefcase. When he opened the door and rushed downstairs he was met by an armed man who quickly tackled him. Primakov screamed hysterically but his cries were silenced by the butt of his assailant's pistol slamming against his head.\n\nAs Primakov awoke, he heard the nameless man say, "What did they say to do again? Stage a suicide?" Another stumbled into the room with a bottle of champagne in one hand. "I don't think they care man, just kill him. Oh look, the pig is waking." The man taunted Primakov by tapping his head with the barrel of the gun rhythmically. "Why! What did I do to deserve this!? I gave the executives everything they asked for, please! What do you want? I-I have money! I ha-" the gunman broke Primakov's nose with a strike from his pistol as he smiled. "Why don't you shut the fuck up and make this easier for the both of us."

He was a Lieutenant then, and after the war with the Germans he'd risen to Colonel. Everything was looking up. They were supposed to be voting for the patriots, right? To keep Russia growing, to keep everything advancing, with corporations to bring wealth into Russia, and for that wealth to fuel the fire of a great nation. Then the President of Russia was killed like a dog in his own home.\n\nNow, the dull roar of the crowd that marched through the capital moved towards the Duma. Andrei's radio buzzed. What was the point of this whole thing, he wondered, if it could devolve so quickly into mob violence and murder?\n\nHis superior's voice echoed through the radio. "Colonel Grigorev, we do not want to open fire outside of the gates, and will let them in. You are ordered to fire upon them if they threaten the security of the Duma."\n\n"Copy. Men, prepare yourselves!" Andrei shouted. His voice was not as strong as it could be, and their response in turn was soft, unsteady, unsure.\n\nThe chants permeated the internal foyer. Andrei shook as he began to hear them. "De-mo-kra-tiya a ne ol-i-gar-khiya! De-mo-kra-tiya a ne ol-i-gar-khiya!" the crowd boomed. It was so much louder than any of them expected. The news reported a small protest. This wasn't fucking small. The crowd was massive, enough to fill the streets as far as the eye could see. Hell, even if they opened fire, he wasn't sure they had enough ammunition to drive them off.\n\nTo Andrei's surprise, Vasily Shukshin stood at the front of the crowd, shouting into a megaphone. "We will not accept this charade! They have killed Primakov, their own man, and now they wish to enchain us as well! What do we say?!"\n\n"HELL NO!" responded the crowd.

His cry echoed through the hall, likely audible within the Duma's chamber itself. And his men, like all good soldiers do, followed their orders. They raised their weapons towards the protestors, and fired. Bullets flew into the crowd like a wave, shredding through the first row with ease. Most were hit in their torsos, sending out bits of blood and gore as the bullets passed through the crowd. Some were hit in the head, shattering their skulls and spraying the air with gray matter and bits of bone. And the soldiers kept firing, not even aiming for anything in particular except the wave that was approaching them and painting the stones of the Duma's foyer red.\n\nPanic gripped those in the back, who quickly surged backwards to try and escape the barrage. Hundreds were trampled in the stampede to escape the bullets, as those who may have survived lay on the ground, bodies stomped into the floor until they were unrecognizable. Bullets hit the walls and ricocheted, flying in all different directions and hitting one of the soldiers in the shoulder, his cries intermixing with the wounded as all let out howls of desperation in the hopes that some salvation would come.\n\nWithin minutes, the firing had stopped. The scene down the hall of the Duma and out into the steps below was that of a slaughter, not a battlefield. There were at least fifty dead just at a glance, and the wounded climbed into the hundreds. Andrei was frozen in shock and horror at what he had witnessed, but what shook him to his core was the body which lay in the center of the foyer. Vasily Shukshin, former President of the Federation, stared back at him with blank eyes, his neck cut open and his body covered in his own blood from a bullet through the throat. Andrei had done his duty, and protected the Duma."

 VRPP.15.t:0 "The People's Triumph"
 VRPP.15.desc:0 "The shouting in the foyer intensified, their yells ringing inside Andrei's skull. He knew his orders. He had to protect the Duma. But these were his fellow citizens, standing alongside the most cherished man in the Federation. As his thoughts raced, he saw one of the protestors get dangerously close to a soldier, who raised his weapon, terrified.\n\n"STOP! Lower your weapons! Lower your weapons!" Colonel Grigorev shouted from behind the soldiers. His words acted as a release on the pressure building in the hall as a strange silence fell upon them all. The soldiers, meant to guard the Duma, lowered their guns as the protestors quieted. Russian looked upon Russian with understanding. They were all the same in this moment. They all wished to have the security they had once had before the VRPP. They wished to see Shukshin return.\n\nThe Colonel looked across the room towards the former President, whose face he had come to know so well over the years. The Colonel was not satisfied with just letting the protestors pass through, and he knew his men wouldn't be either. Taking a deep breath, he yelled, "Demokratiya!"\n\nThe rest of the crowd echoed the Colonel's call. The soldiers too joined in the shouts. A new energy flowed through the protestors. The small fear that choosing to march had been signing their death warrant vanished amongst the crowd. The hope that they might renew the Federation had blossomed into a firm determination that they now had their chance.\n\nThe Colonel turned towards the large doors leading into the Duma's chamber, and threw them open. Protestors surged in, with Shukshin in the center protected by the former Duma guards. Shocked members of the Duma stood up as Colonel Grigorev led Shukshin towards the podium which overlooked the chamber. He grabbed the VRPP member who was currently speaking, shoving his shocked face aside as one of his men took him away.\n\nNow cleared to speak, Shukshin stepped up to the podium and took a deep breath."
 VRPP.15.a:0 "Democracy, not oligarchy!"

 VRPP.16.t:0 "A Final Toast"
 VRPP.16.desc:0 "The winds of Siberia never felt colder. Even through his heavy coat, Alexander Pokryshkin shivered as the chill cut through the heavy leather and fur and nicked its icy claws against his skin. Yet, even if it weren't so cold, he knew he would be shivering. Below Pokryshkin was a stone, set before a mound of dirt, beneath which lay the former President of the Russian Federation: Vasily Shukshin, his closest friend.\n\nHis fingers twisted tightly around the bottle held close to his chest, nearly empty of all of its contents save one final drink. It was the bottle he and Shukshin had shared many years ago when Russia had finally been unified under their great Federation. Unbeknownst to Shukshin, he had kept the bottle as a sort of token of their unified struggle to bring peace to Russia. Yet, it had all fallen apart so quickly.\n\nShukshin shouldn't have died. If that god damned Colonel had kept his cool, then maybe the situation would have calmed down. Shukshin was right all along about these megacorporations. First they had ousted Pokryshkin, then they had killed his successor, and capped off their grand conspiracy by murdering the most beloved man of the Federation, crushing his dream into dust. He had died trying to protect the democracy he had spent so long trying to create.\n\n"I'm sorry, Vasily," Alexander finally spoke to the grave before him. "I should have fought harder. If I had been stronger in character, if we had been stronger, you wouldn't..." His voice cracked. Guilt filled Pokryshkin, gnawing at his heart. He had disagreed with Shukshin on many things, even dreamed that he could take power over him, but he never wanted to be standing over his grave. What had become of their Federation?\n\nThe Siloviki were the answer. It was clear that they had infected every aspect of Russian society, and had played Vasily and Alexander for fools. "I will not stand for it," Pokryshkin declared, his eyes staring straight at the name of his fallen comrade etched deep into the stone. "I will not rest until they pay for your death. You will be avenged, my dearest friend." He carefully took the cap off the bottle, and poured the rest of the contents out onto the snow below."
 VRPP.16.a:0 "As twilight falls, a cold wind sweeps across Siberia."

 VRPP.17.t:0 "Second Chances"
 VRPP.17.desc:0 "The presidential desk in the Duma building hadn't changed a bit since Shukshin had last seen it years ago. It had a bit more wear perhaps, as he did, yet it remained in the same office overlooking the Ob, lit by the setting sun. It was only days since he'd been proclaimed Interim President, and the nation was still reeling. Perhaps that was what had drawn him to journey back to the Federation's home capitol. After all that had happened in Moscow he'd needed a taste of home.\n\nMoscow, Primakov and Zubakov, the sight of the All-Russian Army storming his Duma, it all made him sick. The Federation, his Federation, had come too close to slipping back into the corporate hands he'd risked everything to wrestle it from. Losing to Primakov was his greatest failure, there was no doubt. He had failed his coalition, his country, his people, and himself. Pokryshkin, for all his faults, did what he thought was best. The corporations were a tool, not a paycheck at the expense of all those around him. And in the end, his appeasement of their every last demand hadn't mattered. He was left replaced and as expendable as the people he'd sold to his masters.\n\nShukshin rummaged through the desk drawers and found his first draft of the Environmental Protection Act, preserved almost perfectly. Just another piece of his legacy that had been left shattered. It couldn't be said how much further Zubakov would've gotten, but one thing was clear: the Russian Dream had died with Shukshin's presidency.\n\nShukshin looked out to the Ob. Its waters had already become muddled with dirt and waste once more. No more. Primakov's desecration of his homeland could never be allowed to happen again. At any cost, he wouldn't let it. The Army would see to it that someone like Zubakov would never see a Duma seat, let alone the Presidency, again. After they had looked down the barrel of Primakov's presidency, the people would never allow it either. No, this time it will be different. It had to be.\n\nShukshin thought he would be left invigorated by his new mandate to govern, filled with determination to undo Primakov's mistakes. But he saw now how foolish that was. There was no more will, rage, spite, or vengeance in him as he stared into the sunlight reflected in the Ob."
 VRPP.17.a:0 "All that remained was emptiness."

 VRPP.18.t:0 "The Perfect Dictatorship"
 VRPP.18.desc:0 "Yevgeny Primakov sat alone, slumped over his luxurious mahogany desk, rubbing his temples. The party was the same as all the other parties with the megacorporation heads: exhausting. Another day, another balancing act, the maintaining of a system which produces unprecedented growth by empowering business while keeping it just controlled enough to prevent its own destruction. The people out there in their castles of gold and guns, they do not understand what is needed for this economy - no, for this country.\n\nOnly Yevgeny Primakov and his closest advisors truly comprehend the scope of the massive machine, the media contacts, the shell companies carefully constructed, the blackmail and bribes.\n\nPrimakov reached for his bottle of imported gin and a Turkish cigar. He shakily took a drag from his cigar before drinking a deep shot of whiskey, letting the flavors combine in his mouth into a smoky and fiery embrace.\n\nOnly Yevgeny Primakov understood this machine, and only he could manage it. What would happen if he died? Collapse? Anarchy? Another German invasion? It weighed on him. He had all of the power in the world, but above his head was a vast Sword of Damocles. The metal above him was held by a complex Rube-Goldberg machine, one that could not be comprehended by a public, but by an individual.\n\nPrimakov stared above his own head at the pale white light nuzzled within a divot on the ceiling of his office. Were that its light could transport him to something close to heaven. But there was no heaven here.\n\nRussia, so close to progress, so far from God."
 VRPP.18.a:0 "A sublime house of cards."

 VRPP.19.t:0 "Flip the Switch"
 VRPP.19.desc:0 "Alexander Popov ran a grubby, beringed paw over his bald spot. A hunk of ash fell from his substantial cigar onto the crimson tie pinned to his stinking, sweat-stained shirt. It burned for a second, then suffocated on the cheap fabric. "Let me run this by you," the obese editor said. "You're telling me that Yevgeny Primakov, our President, was involved with a bunch of homicidal maniacs during the anarchy?"\n\n"Not just any homicidal maniacs, sir," Soelma Badmaeva replied. She was of Buryat descent, a mousy young woman who looked as though she'd prefer to retreat into a corner than even order a coffee at a restaurant. That seeming vulnerability had served her well as an up-and coming journalist at Alexander's rag newspaper. "But the Black League of Omsk! I was able to track down one of their former leaders, General Yuri Drozdov. Apparently Primakov's involvement was fairly substantial."\n\n"I see." Popov took a puff of his cigar. His liver spots wrinkled as he smoked the last days of his life away. "Do you have any evidence beyond this Drozdov's recollection?"\n\nShe gritted her teeth. "Most of the League's records were destroyed when it became clear Omsk was falling. They had this plan to retake West Siberia, a whole operation laid out-" Popov cleared his throat. "I'm sorry. What matters is, they didn't want their personnel picked off one by one. Payrolls, promotions, awards - they're all gone."\n\n"Then we have nothing."\n\n"We have a lead. If you'll let me, I can get a few others from the office, ask a few more questions-"\n\nAlexander slammed his hand on the table. "Listen! You're talking about accusing a sitting President of... what, murder? War crimes? If we accuse him, every eye in the Federation will be on us. We'll be sued, and we'll have to prove our accusations in court. I can't afford to make enemies like that. Can the fucking story.""

His death has been officially ruled a terror attack, however very few observers believe these reports to be true. Many have stated Primakov's death to be the work of the Federation's megacorporations, who Primakov worked with extensively and had recently shown disapproval of his administration.\n\nImmediately following the news reaching the steps of the Duma, Yuri Zubakov, a former intelligence officer that worked for the Feniks Holding Group, was instated by an overwhelming vote as Interim President. Protests have already begun across the nation, led by a wide coalition of all those against Zubakov's inauguration. As the country holds its breath, only time will tell what will become of Russia."

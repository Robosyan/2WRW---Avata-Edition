 NOV_the_koryagin_presidency_desc:0 "Anatoly Koryagin, head of the £NOV_RSLP_Icon §MRSLP§!, has triumphed in the Russian elections and has been proclaimed President of the Russian Federation! With a new era of peace on the way after decades of warfare in Russia and abroad, its time for the President to address his people and outline his agenda to Russia and the world."
 
 NOV_koryagin_peace_is_possible:0 "Peace is Possible"
 NOV_koryagin_peace_is_possible_desc:0 "The newly-inaugurated President Koryagin has many detractors. Some say his vision of peace and prosperity is but a fool's errand, merely a baseless ideal from which to draw the support of the gullible masses. These cynics may be well intentioned in meaning to protect the Federation from pointless and destructive policy, but it makes them no less misguided.\n\nPresident Koryagin has laid out a comprehensive set of policies to bring a new era of peace. At the home front, decreasing military spending, increasing social spending, and decentralizing both the economy and nation are to become key points of domestic policy, while international cooperation and furthering relations with the OFN will become the foundation of foreign affairs. The President may have his work cut out for him, but he stands ready to see it through."

 NOV_koryagin_prepare_our_diplomats_desc:0 "With our goals set and intentions clear, it's time to begin the first step towards integrating the Federation completely into the free world.\n\nPresident Koryagin and Foreign Minister Kovalev will travel across the democratic world to cement our commitments to international cooperation and peace, while at home our politicians will battle tooth-and-nail to protect our agenda against £GFX_NOV_DSPR_Icon §PSocialist§! agitators and £NOV_VRPP_Icon §gReactionary§! holdouts. The £NOV_RSLP_Icon §MRSLP§! has Russia's best intentions in mind, and we must remind our people of such even if it takes a little.. convincing to get them on board."
 
 NOV_to_golmud:0 "To Golmud"
 NOV_to_golmud_desc:0 "The western states of China have been the last bastion of Chinese freedom for decades. However, throughout their time struggling to return freedom to their nation, they have remained isolated diplomatically and cut off from the world with only minor recognition and aid from the OFN. This state of affairs cannot continue.\n\nPresident Koryagin is to embark on a state visit to the free Chinese capital of Golmud. Sending this offering of peace is sure to give the Federation a stronger diplomatic hold in Asia and force the Rising Sun and its puppets to reconsider the state of their supposed hegemony in the region. Perhaps, we can even move the OFN to aid them beyond a few weapons. If our quest for peace is to spread to Asia, it must begin here."
 
 NOV_to_washington:0 "To Washington"
 NOV_to_washington_desc:0 "The United States has stood unquestionably as the leader of the free world since the end of the Second World War.\n\nOur stunning victory over the forces of Nazi tyranny has cemented the democratic ideals of our Federation for years to come, accomplishing what even America could not several decades ago. With Koryagin's diplomatic expertise and our near bottomless international good-will, we will send our President to the Land of the Free to foster a new, equal partnership between our great Federation and the United States of America."
 
 NOV_to_delhi:0 "To Delhi"
 NOV_to_delhi_desc:0 "The Republic of India has suffered much under the rule of the so-called "Civilized West". From brutal colonial crackdowns to massive deadly famines, the Indian subcontinent has seen the very worst excesses of European imperialism.\n\nWhile Russia used to bear the title of an "Empire", it has reborn itself into a new age of democracy under the title of "Federation". Far removed are the days of the so-called "Great Game" from our present reality. From now on we must move forward with Delhi on even grounds, for a democratic ally in the Orient could prove the tipping point in the battle against Japanese imperialism in the East."
 
 NOV_brothers_through_suffering:0 "Brothers Through Suffering"
 NOV_brothers_through_suffering_desc:0 "The story of the Allies is one of suffering, defiance, and most of all, conviction. Millions still remember the day the Swastika flew over Red Square or the evacuation from the British Isles as their defining image of the Second World War. One of unstoppable fascist dominance over the brave but ultimately hopeless Allied resistance.\n\nIt is undeniable that since then, Russia has experienced the brunt of genocidal Nazi imperialism, with millions of our own perishing in the name of German “living space”. But without the OFN standing as a unifying beacon of resistance against our mortal enemies, what would have stood between the Axis and complete world dominance?\n\nWe owe much of our current rise to the tenacity of Washington's resistance, just as Washington owes the fall of the Reich's hegemony to our continued struggle. Together in purpose and strength, the Allies now stand stronger than ever. United not only by ideological determination, but by the soldiers that rest beneath our soil."
 
 NOV_partners_through_circumstance:0 "Partners Through Circumstance"
 NOV_partners_through_circumstance_desc:0 "While it is true that we share a strong ideological bond with our American counterparts across the ocean, in the end it is our economic and military status that keeps our relationship an equal one.\n\nDuring the Warlord Era it was the Silvoki that pushed for increased trade links with the OFN, hoping to increase the power and recognition of the Novosibirsk conglomerates that dominated our economy up until the Second West Russian War.\n\nToday it is our Federation that stands tall over Europe, and the OFN has not been keen to sit out on potential profits. Under President Koryagin we will take our economic relationship to new heights, empowering the Dollar and the Ruble side-by-side."
 
 NOV_our_place_in_the_free_world:0 "Our Place in the Free World"
 NOV_our_place_in_the_free_world_desc:0 "Our time has arrived. President Koryagin, once seen as nothing more than a naïve idealist, not fit to run a nation as populous in land or people as the Federation, has not only secured the support of his own people, but the support of the entire democratic world.\n\nBroadcasted from within the halls of the Federal Assembly in Novosibirsk, our admission into the Organization of Free Nations will be plastered onto every television screen in not just Russia, but the United States as well. Our politicians will shake hands with their American counterparts as the streets roar and cameras roll, showcasing in real-time our dedication to the international cause of freedom and prosperity as promised at the very beginning of our presidency."

 NOV_koryagin_scale_back_military_spending:0 "Scale Back Military Spending"
 NOV_koryagin_scale_back_military_spending_desc:0 "The All-Russian Army has throughout its history been a proud arm of the Federation, a necessity for its survival against all who would destroy the Federation and the force single-handedly responsible for the liberation of Russia from the Nazi jackboot. However, as the winds of change continue to sweep across the Federation, its steadfast duty becomes progressively more unnecessary.\n\nMilitary spending has become nothing but a sink in which billions of scarce rubles are dumped into. It would be a disservice to continue to waste these funds so recklessly. The military budget will be considerably slashed and siphoned to other programs, which while angering the VRPP and the more hawkish of the RAPP, is a necessary prerequisite for the path to come."
 
 NOV_koryagin_promote_decentralisation:0 "Promote Decentralization"
 NOV_koryagin_promote_decentralisation_desc:0 "Our great Federation has struggled with the centralization of power and control since its foundation. Under Pokryshkin, megacorporations and the elite dominated all facets of the economy, and while Shukshin took many measures to gut corporate influence, they remain far too vital to our nation's economic workings.\n\nWhile the industrial giants have their place, it is not as the commanding force of an entire nation's economy. Industry and commerce shall be decentralized and economically devolved to smaller companies and businesses. No more will the nation be bogged down by corporate dominance and excess governmental regulations aimed to support their allies. The market shall reign supreme and unshackled."
 
 NOV_koryagin_no_price_too_high:0 "No Price Too High"
 NOV_koryagin_no_price_too_high_desc:0 "The prosperity of our people remains President Koryagin's first and foremost domestic policy goal. Russia's citizens must not be forgotten in the pursuit of a peaceful world, and this must be reflected in the Federation's economy and social welfare.\n\nGovernment programs which would protect our people from being left destitute and impoverished are an absolute necessity to the nation and must be expanded en masse. These programs will not be without their costs, but this will be made up for in part by reallocating the budget of other government sectors such as the military. It cannot be promised that these costs will even out, but the people of the Federation must take priority to a few petty rubles."
 
 NOV_koryagin_no_challenge_too_great:0 "No Challenge Too Great"
 NOV_koryagin_no_challenge_too_great_desc:0 "There are no means to the end of peace which can be ignored. Cooperation across the world must extend beyond diplomacy, into culture, into the economy, and most of all into the sciences. A global effort to further the progress of all mankind, if it is to succeed, must be done with the aid of all nations of the world.\n\nInternational cooperation with all nations who pioneer the development of science must be pursued. Coordination of research and sharing scientific developments will propel the advancement of science to a speed never before seen. Humanity will look to the future for the betterment of all who dream of a better tomorrow, and together we cannot fail."

 NOV_shukshins_heart:0 "Shukshin's Heart"
 NOV_shukshins_heart_desc:0 "Vasily Shukshin is undeniably the most popular man in all of our Federation. Through his leadership, Russia managed to prove true what none thought possible, decimating the National Socialist colossus and liberating all of the enslaved peoples who inhabited their colonial states.\n\nWhile he may stand against the "blind idealism" of President Koryagin, the former writer has shown sympathy for our quest for peace. With no clear intention of running against us in the future, it may prove wise to utilize his massive support base in our favor."
 
 NOV_kantorovichs_mind:0 "Kantorovich's Mind"
 NOV_kantorovichs_mind_desc:0 "Of all parties which constituted the Shukshin's original coalition, there were none more tenuously aligned than Kantorovich's £GFX_NOV_DSPR_Icon §PDemocratic Socialists§!. Their heavy handed economic tactics and overenthusiastic spending put them into a position of staunch opposition to Shushkin's policies, citing them as not going nearly far enough. However, President Koryagin believes there is room for compromise, especially as we are more left-wing when compared to the £NOV_RAPP_Icon §BRAPP§!.\n\nIf our policies are to succeed, we must rally the support of all who stand opposed to the £GFX_NOV_VRPP_Icon §gVRPP§! and our nascent democracy. The £NOV_RSLP_Icon §MRSLP§! continues to stand as an underdog in the Duma, and so the support, even if hesitant, of the £GFX_NOV_DSPR_Icon §PDSPR§! must be pursued. We must find common ground, for peace and for the common man."
 
 NOV_expand_the_republics:0 "Expand the Republics"
 NOV_expand_the_republics_desc:0 "In Novosibirsk and Barnaul, back in the Federation's earliest days, the federal model of governance upon which our state was founded was used as a pragmatic method to ease administration in a time of war. However, today it serves a different purpose. The many minorities and peoples of Russia call for freedom of self determination, and it is our duty to give it to them.\n\nPokryshkin's vision of solely practical administrative divides must truly and finally be laid to rest. Republics and other autonomous provinces in our great Federation will finally have their rightly owed autonomy and be given the right to choose their own destiny. While they will stay within our Federation under the most vital national laws, these autonomous republics will finally be free of central overreach. Such is their right as free citizens just as any other to govern themselves."

 NOV_a_trip_to_barnaul_desc:0 "Barnaul was the junior partner of the duo which constituted the Federation's initial territory, but this makes it no less important to the legacy of our great government. In the city remains an abundance of government history and documents which could prove useful to President Koryagin's policy agenda.\n\nNow that the President's initial and most pressing pieces of his platform have begun to be seen through, he shall return to where Shukshin's movement against the Siloviki began. The Federation continues to look evermore ahead, but we must respect how it began, and there would be no better way than to look to Barnaul."
 
 NOV_amending_our_wrongs:0 "Amending Our Wrongs"
 NOV_amending_our_wrongs_desc:0 "Our Federation is not a state without its flaws. We have committed many horrible acts in the pursuit of a unified Russia, most of which under Pokryshkin and his thuggish reign. This was most apparent in the early 1960s, during which the socialist Narodnik movement was brutally and senselessly repressed through bloodshed, all the while ignoring the needs of the people.\n\nPresident Koryagin has dictated this sickening crime cannot go forgotten or unatoned for. Posthumous pardons and formal apologies to the victims of the crackdown are to be given effective immediately. This may not go over well with the §greactionaries§! of the Federation, but it is a moral necessity. We may never wipe the stain of our failures off our past, but we may attempt to seek forgiveness."
 
 NOV_opportunity_for_all:0 "Opportunity For All"
 NOV_opportunity_for_all_desc:0 "There is no greater measure of a nation's freedom than the opportunity afforded to its citizens. It is the right of all free men to be given a fair chance to succeed, yet the Federation has continued to fall short of providing this right to its people.\n\nNew public works programs and other means of lifting up those who struggle on our streets are to be rolled out in the coming weeks. Aid - means tested for maximum efficiency -  will be given to all those who struggle to feed themselves and their families, most of all the veterans left jobless in the wake of peace. If the Federation is to reach its greatest potential, it must allow all its people a chance to as well, within reason, of course."

 NOV_koryagin_the_quest_for_peace:0 "The Quest for Peace"
 NOV_koryagin_the_quest_for_peace_desc:0 "President Koryagin has made incredible strides in his struggle to bring peace to the world. The Federation now lies as part of the free world in earnest, and its economy and administration have become more free of unneeded control and regulation than ever. Russia has made great strides in becoming a freer, more prosperous nation, more so than ever.\n\nSome called the President's agenda unattainable, nothing but an ideal that could never see reality, but these naysayers have been proven wrong. The Federation has risen to greater heights than ever, all without bloodshed, conflict, or unneeded pain. President Koryagin continues to work towards a nation and world truly at peace, but one thing has become clear:\n\n§MHe's only getting started.§!"

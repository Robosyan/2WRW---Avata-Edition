 NOV_meet_with_pokryshkin_desc:0 "The President has called Pokryshkin and all military leaders across the Federation to return to Novosibirsk and convene in the war room to plan the Federation's strategy in the upcoming war against the German Reich. Here, we will not only review our drafted plan of attack, but also figure out what logistical preparations the All-Russian Army needs to make before we can begin the liberation of Eastern Europe from Nazi tyranny."

 NOV_send_in_the_spies_desc:0 "Pokryshkin has made it clear to the President that if we are to liberate our sacred Moscow from the Nazi occupiers and repel them from our lands, the first course of action would be to send in agents of the Sluzhba Bezopasnosti behind enemy lines to gather intelligence and weaken [MCW.GetNameDef] from within.\n\nNot only will we gather information, but we can begin to lay the groundwork for potential revolts behind the enemy's frontlines. We too, can learn from our communist forbears."

 NOV_weaken_their_administration_desc:0 "[MCW.GetNameDefCap]'s hold on their territory is tenuous at best, often battling partisans and rebels across the nation, primarily near our border. With the right men shot dead by our agents and certain individuals going missing, their weak administration will rapidly turn to skeletal, breaking any illusion of control they think they have over the occupied lands of Western Russia. When the time is right, we will use this to our advantage."
 
 NOV_sabotage_factories:0 "Sabotage Their Factories"
 NOV_sabotage_factories_desc:0 "To defeat a nation swiftly, it is imperative that we knock out their industrial capabilities as quickly as possible. Annihilating their industrial capacity will hinder their efforts to resupply their armies and allow us to use our relative material superiority to crush their troops beneath the boot of the advancing All-Russian Army."

 NOV_they_are_broken_desc:0 "The Sluzhba Bezopasnosti's final target are the officer corps of the [MCW.GetAdjective].

 NOV_prepare_western_defences:0 "Prepare Western Defences"
 NOV_prepare_western_defences_desc:0 "Marshal Novikov has made it clear that it would be foolish to not prepare any defenses for the war ahead. Our western border is vulnerable to a German counteroffensive, lacking the necessary fortifications to halt a potential advance into our lands in their tracks. We must begin mobilizing the nation and prepare for the unfortunate but very real possibility that the war will not go so smoothly."

 NOV_build_up_airbases_desc:0 "It won't matter how many old MIG-17's and YAK-15's the Federation has produced to face the Luftwaffe in the skies if we lack the airfields and modern equipment required to field our vast fleet. Pokryshkin has recommended we expand the existing airfields in Russia and produce new MIG-23's as quickly as possible.\n\n"If we lose the war in the air, we lose the war and we lose it quickly." - Bernard L.

 NOV_watch_the_barents_sea_desc:0 "As we make our defensive preparations for the coming war with Germany, our advisors have pointed out one of the Federation's great weaknesses.\n\nThe Barents Sea.\n\nThe Germans will undoubtedly have naval superiority throughout the war and may use this advantage to exploit our northern weaknesses to breach our coastline. We must take necessary measures to reinforce Northern Russia and ensure that the Germans make it no further than the cold shores of Arkhangelsk."

 NOV_condemn_the_reich_desc:0 "It is time for the Federation to speak directly to the Reich and to the world at large. The people of the world must never forget the unforgivable crimes the German Reich has inflicted upon the Russian people and the peoples of Europe for forty long years. We will publicly condemn the Reich in an open letter, and let them, and all of the world, know that Russia fights for freedom and human decency against the forces of evil."
 
 NOV_mobilise_the_federation:0 "Mobilize the Federation"
 NOV_mobilise_the_federation_desc:0 "To defeat the Nazi menace, we must complete the Federation's transition to a war economy. Key industrial sectors will be temporarily nationalized and all production reorganized for the conflict against the German superpower. The entire Russian economy will be transformed from simple tools and products to weapons of total warfare which will be necessary to liberate the Muscovite people from the chains of oppression."

 NOV_a_blitzkrieg_of_our_own_desc:0 "When the Germans invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, they overwhelmed the unprepared Red Army with their mass assault of tanks, planes and mechanized divisions, using the Blitzkrieg to overwhelm Belarus and Ukraine and seize our sacred Moscow.\n\nThey caught us off-guard.\n\nBut not this time.\n\nThis time, it will be the All-Russian Army that overruns the Wehrmacht with such speed and ferocity that we will have the Wehrmacht fleeing west in the same panic and fear that the Russian Army had once felt."

 NOV_to_liberate_russia_desc:0 "The finest war machines blaze into German holdings, ready to liberate Moscow. In airfields all around West Russia, plane after plane takes off, ready to sacrifice their lives to defend the brave ones fighting the menace on foot. In Arkhangelsk, the Russian Fleet sets sail, getting ready to defend our hard won Arctic holdings. Millions march with strict precision, rifles aimed forward, killing all who stand in our way.\n\nOf course, every tank needs its fuel, and all armies need soldiers. This is why ramping up conscription is the only option if we want to keep enough men in the ranks of our already massive army. More able bodied men shall serve, and the All-Russian Army will grow even stronger!\n\nOnwards!"

 NOV_brave_sons_of_russia_desc:0 "Although the All-Russian Army is mighty enough as it is, we mustn't forget that the Wehrmacht outnumber us. Thus, the only way to counter the vast armies of the Nazi Reich is to conscript more brave young men into the ranks of the All-Russian Army.\n\nFor every brave son of our Motherland they knock down, those bastards will only discover a hundred more vengeful men waiting for them with their rifles fixated between their eyes!"

 NOV_onwards_to_moscow_desc:0 "Comrades!\n\nOur progress to liberate Russia has gone swiftly and decisively, and the oil wells of Caucasia and the sacred cities of Saint Petersburg and Moscow have been rightfully returned to us.\n\nHowever, now is not the time to slow down and consolidate our position. Rather, we shall do the opposite! The time is ripe for a brand new offensive, one that will tear apart what's left of the Wehrmacht and liberate what still remains in the Germans' grimy hands.\n\n§RIt's time for… Operation Bagration.§!"

 NOV_recruit_the_slaves_desc:0 "Throughout the war, the partisan forces deep within the occupied lands of the Reich have hindered the German war machine at every turn.

 NOV_remember_whats_at_stake_desc:0 ""Some of our generals are worried about possible German counterattacks.\n\nI say, let them come!\n\nOur forces do not fear the Wehrmacht! The average German soldier, slow and weak without his metal shield, is no match for the mighty All-Russian Army! Wherever they attempt to attack, they shall be met with a shower of lead, rained down by line after line of patriotic young Russian men, arms at the ready, all willing to lay their lives down for the good of Russia and all of the peoples of Europe!\n\nThe All-Russian Army shall march onwards, unrelenting!" - Alexander Pokryshkin"
 
 NOV_deal_with_america:0 "Call upon the OFN"
 NOV_deal_with_america_desc:0 "The OFN is our natural ally in our struggle against the Reich. However, asking them to get involved directly in the conflict would be asking too much and only push the globe closer to nuclear annihilation. Still, there is much they could do to assist us in our struggle against Germany, such as selling us their weapons and mobilizing volunteer divisions from America, Canada and Australia to join the frontlines and aid in the fight against the fascist menace!"

 NOV_expand_intelligence_presence_desc:0 "The Sluzhba Bezopasnosti has for years been the silent and deadly hand of the Federation.

 NOV_airforce_patrols_desc:0 "Since the founding of the Federation in the early 1950s, we have always prided ourselves on our air capabilities. Through the strength of our airforce, we have been able to triumph over our enemies from Moscow to Magadan.\n\nNow that the Luftwaffe has been beaten and repelled from the skies of Russia, we can now turn our air capabilities against the partisans.

 NOV_empower_military_governments_desc:0 "Although the President does not wish to grant the military too much power in the reconstruction zones, if the partisan threat is to be dealt with swiftly and effectively, it would appear that the President has no choice but to do so.\n\nBy allowing military governors to temporarily abolish habeas corpus and other rights of the incarcerated or suspected, we can best utilize our counterinsurgency operators to finally bring peace to the war-torn region. Once that is done, peace and stability may finally return, and reconstruction may begin in earnest."

 NOV_send_humanitarian_aid_desc:0 "Across the newly liberated west, millions of people are homeless and starving. Decades of German mismanagement and the atrocities the Wehrmacht committed against the innocent people of Eastern Europe throughout the war have devastated the population.\n\nThe Federation must be swift in aiding our western brothers and sisters through this difficult time in our history by providing emergency shelter and food.

So many beautiful sights that once upon a time, were a testament to our strength, ingenuity, and intelligence as a nation.\n\nNow they lie in ruin, left to rot or made into practice targets by the Wehrmacht. Centuries of Russian achievements, destroyed or bastardized into 'Germanic' eyesores. The Kremlin, the heart of Moscow, turned into a mere military base for the Wehrmacht. This is unacceptable. We need to restore our lost history as quickly as possible, no matter the cost.\n\nTheir value to our people, the lessons they leave, no matter how dark some may be, are invaluable in ensuring that the mistakes of the past are never repeated."

Many construction projects are taking many more weeks to complete without the more modern tools the workers of the Russian Federation currently enjoy.\n\nIf we which to rebuild the administrative heart of Muscovy as swiftly as possible, it would be pertinent to support their reconstruction efforts and send some of the Federations construction equipment to the West Russian Reconstruction Zone."

 NOV_begin_local_elections_desc:0 "With the people's bellies full, roofs over their heads, and freedom from fascist partisans, the people in European Russia can finally breathe. Government decades have been translated and disseminated in Russia, giving us the administrative capacity to operate the first local elections in the Moscow area - just in time. The people clamor for our Federation's promises to be made whole, as our soldiers report citizens asking for when they will be able to vote for their leaders.\n\nFor decades, the Muscovites had been deprived of choice in their own land. They could not elect anyone to represent them in any form of government, forced to be mere oppressed subjects.\n\nTheir enthusiasm for democracy is promising and shows the Federation that Western Russia is becoming more and more ready to rejoin the Motherland and embrace its values of liberty and democracy."

 NOV_encourage_foreign_investment_desc:0 "The reconstruction of Muscovite cities is helping the region recover on a basic level, but without any foreign investment, Muscovy will not be able to become as economically competitive and innovative as Central Siberia or the Volga.\n\nWe should encourage investors from America and Japan to set up or invest in the newly liberated lands of Muscovy to help the troubled region recover. With the lowest prices imaginable, and a virtually untapped marketplace, these businesses will do good and do well, helping our troubled region prosper economically while making a killing for shareholders back home."

 NOV_rebuild_western_cities_desc:0 "As the All-Russian Army marched westwards, many Muscovite cities were turned into battlefields, fought over between our brave sons and the Wehrmacht's dogs.\n\nAs a result, most of these cities were damaged, with many Muscovites losing their homes in the fighting. While our emergency aid was able provide temporary shelter, it was meager living, mainly tents and military rations. We cannot rebuild a nation on such barebones conditions, and we cannot stand idly by while our historic lands suffer.\n\nWe will begin reconstruction efforts in earnest, rebuilding our cities brick by brick with legions of workers from the Federation's interior and soldiers stationed in the Moscow area. The work will be long, but when we are done, our people will once more have a place to call home."

 NOV_support_rural_muscovites_desc:0 "For decades, Muscovy has been seen by the world as the backwater of Europe, a poor rural subject of the Reich, good for its slave labor and nothing more. Any progress made in urbanizing and industrializing these lands was quickly undone during our advance into 'Mosckowien'.\n\nWith Muscovy firmly under our control, our first step should be to re-industrialize these lands as soon as possible, starting with modernizing the agricultural industries of the west, lifting the peasants out of poverty and bringing the region up to par with the rest of the Federation as fast as possible. With this, many peasants will be unneeded, and may move to the cities, giving us a large workforce for a nascent industrial base."

 NOV_create_new_oppertunities_desc:0 "Whilst the modernization of agriculture in Muscovy is a great first step in developing these broken lands, it will be through the powerful fist of industrialization that we will transform this Eastern European backwater into the economic and industrial heart of the Russian Federation.\n\nAlready, several Russian companies have requested to build new factories in these lands, now ripe with opportunity. Many of the ruined factories that had existed during the days of the old union can be easily rebuilt within weeks and offer jobs to millions of Muscovites who were left jobless following the war, along with the former peasants who, now being redundant in their family farm's daily operations, will seek new opportunities to make money.\n\nThe people of Muscovy require jobs and opportunity to accelerate its economic development and the Russian Federation shall deliver."

 NOV_reintroduce_russian:0 "Reintroduce Russian"
 NOV_reintroduce_russian_desc:0 "For decades, the Muscovites have been forced to learn and speak the language of their former oppressors. The result of this is a clear language barrier that has created a large divide between Muscovy and the Russian Federation. While the older folk know how to speak, and many read, fluent Russian, the youth are illiterate. Though the Russian language was kept as a sort of thieves cant, the inability to write in Cyrillic is extremely troublesome.\n\nWe do not expect to overcome this large language barrier any time soon, but by formally reintroducing Russian as the official language of the region, we can slowly begin to heal the cultural and linguistic damage done by the Germans."

 NOV_promote_russian_culture_desc:0 "If we want the people of Muscovy to fully embrace their Russian heritage, we must promote all aspects of Russian tradition and culture, both new and old, throughout Muscovy.\n\nWhether that means being seen on the television, heard on the radio or surrounding them in the streets they walk on, the Muscovites will remember their roots. Given time, Muscovy will be blessed with a cultural rebirth and be just as Russian as any other Russian city within the Federation."

Hailing from the vast plains of Siberia, the Federation has reunited all of Russia and successfully liberated the peoples of Eastern Europe from its servitude to their former masters.\n\nWith the map of Eastern Europe redrawn, we can now step forth and move our attention beyond Russia, towards Eastern Europe proper. The people of Europe yearn for freedom and the Federation will do everything in its power to ensure that the continent is liberated from the rule of tyrants."

We have come with a promise of liberty, and plan to redefine our relationship with Ukraine. We are not new colonial masters, but friends of the peoples of Ukraine.\n\nWe do not expect to win over the hearts and minds of every Ukrainian through mere words. Actions speak louder then words, and helping them rebuild their cities and townships is a great place to start. With Russians and Ukrainians working side by side to rebuild the lands of Ukraine, new bonds of brotherhood can be established between our two peoples.\n\nA bond not easily broken."

 NOV_the_ukrainian_language_desc:0 "Much like in Western Russia, Ukrainians endured the attempted Germanization of their nation at the hands of the Reich.\n\nOwing to its more western location, entire areas of the region have been dominated by German settlers, most notably the Crimean Peninsula. Our work to educate our Ukrainian brethren on their own language will require much more work than our previous efforts in Muscovy, but we must persevere. We will not let the German colonizers have the last laugh and let the Ukrainian people lose their culture and language due to mere sloth."

 NOV_to_the_history_books_desc:0 "Under the rule of the Reich, Ukraine was a land of many contrasts. Many groups from the German government, the Ukrainian collaborators, to the reformist industrialists, all vied for power and influence over the former Reichskommisariat. Their squabbling came at the expense of all, even the settlers, as Ukraine was left as a one-commodity nation, fully dependent on agriculture.\n\nThe legacy of the decades of political conflict still has an affect of the Ukrainian psyche and economy. However, with these groups either dead or their power significantly reduced, we can begin to establish a government the Ukrainian people can finally put their faith in and leave the turmoil of the past consigned to the history books."

Once we've secured the region, we will have to enact an all encompassing economic plan to work towards as we begin the process of rebuilding.

They have been ejected from their homes, from their language, and from their pride. But this has not come without consequence.\n\nThe Germans have created a long-reaching spectre of resentment and anger we can utilize to cause instability. With our intelligence services and our connections to partisans in Poland, we can destabilize the government to prepare for our eventual intervention.

Even after their attempted genocide of the Armenian people after the First World War, the Fifth Inspectorate General deported millions of Armenians to the arid Levant and caused a great revolt that was quelled in rivers of bloodshed.\n\nAlthough the Turks have failed in the past, if nothing is done to save the Armenian people from Turkish oppression, the Grey Wolves may one day successfully exterminate the peoples of Armenia.\n\nThis is unacceptable, we will not stand by this obvious genocide! The Federation cannot stand by and watch as what was done to our people is done to the Armenians. We must do what we can to liberate the Armenians from Turkish oppression and ensure that the ancient identity and culture of Armenia survives."

We will not be working with ultranationalists or their like, but our recent successes have created a lot of opportunities for helping build up a democratic movement for the liberation of Armenia. This movement will be far more successful in winning over undecided people who are more moderate, along with even some Turkish people in the area, if we promise they'll be treated humanely under a new administration.\n\nBy gaining the upper hand in information and in the war of words, we can neutralize the advantages the Turks would normally have, and lay the groundwork for one more Armenian revolt."

Luckily for the rebels, they have the vast resources of the Russian Federation now available to them - provided they abide by certain standards.\n\nWith the Armenians committed to democracy fully equipped with the best equipment we can offer, they can turn the tide and beat back the Turkish forces, bringing new hope for the noble cause of Armenian liberation from Turkish tyranny."

 NOV_reunification.1.desc:0 "President Shukshin stood before a vast crowd of supporters who had gathered from as far as Arkhangelsk to hear their President speak. Long gone was the nervousness in his voice from when he had fought for democracy in Novosibirsk, he had grown into his role as Russia's champion of democracy - and hopefully, their liberator.\n\n"Russia is one!" the President proclaimed.\n\nImmediately, the crowd erupted in cheers of celebration. It was almost hard to believe it. A people, once so submissive and broken in an age of warlordism, now proud and hopeful of the days ahead. It proved a belief that Shukshin held: people could not be truly defeated. Their humiliation was temporary, bound to return with great energy!\n\nShukshin let them continue their cheering until they fell back into silence as the President spoke again.\n\n"However, not all Russians are with us this day. Millions of our people beyond our borders still live under occupation. Their rights as human beings striped from them, reduced to second class citizens in their own land. To those people unfortunate enough to live under such conditions, hear me when I say this".\n\nShukshin paused for a moment, a proud smirk emerging on his face as he gazed upon the crowds of thousands before him, watching him in silence - as was the rest of the world.\n\n"Your liberation is coming!".\n\nThe crowd cheered wildly as Shukshin looked toward the skies, basking in the sunlight and the cool air. He felt it, the winds of change in the afternoon breeze. Things were different now and the doubting world would have it proven to them."

With the Russian Federation reformed and prepared for the difficult road ahead, Vasily felt the nation was finally ready to address the matter of Vladivostok. A city built by Russian hands, populated by Russians, stolen by the Japanese Empire at gunpoint. Could he do it? Could he pull off a negotiation with a superpower? His popularity would skyrocket if they could retake their Far Eastern lands, but if he were to fail in this endeavor… The increasingly anxious President ran a hand through his hair, sifting through the possibilities in his head.\n\nRight on cue, Pokryshkin entered his office.

We can't ignore Vladivostok".\n\nThe Falcon nodded, placing several files down on Vasily's desk. "I've spoken with some of my colleagues, and we've come up with several proposals to deal with the Japanese." Shukshin took one of the folders and opened it. "Most of our solutions involve a Japanese leaning economic treaty that would last for the next couple of years. We could allow their Zaibatsus to set up shop in Chita and Magadan for resources; we can get investments from them to help develop the Far East, in addition to reclaiming Vladivostok. Alternatively, we could offer them support through the current oil crisis."\n\nThe Falcon grinned, pointing to the second folder. "This one gives them a deal they literally can't reject.

 NOV_reunification.6.desc:0 "Nikolai smiled for the first time in a long time. Since the days of the Soviet Union, he had never felt anything but despair. His life had been constant suffering; he lost his father in Moscow, his mother and little brother had succumbed to hunger while his sister had been worked to death in factories of Perm, making bullets for those Nazi-loving bastards, and all the while he barely stayed alive by living off the wilderness. West Russia was eventually unified, and some sort of benefits came from that - but he still worked in a factory, still struggled to survive. When [WSR.GetNameDef] was defeated by the Siberian Federation, Nikolai was similarly pessimistic. A rule by corporations and their strongmen Siloviki, hah! Just one more despot in a long line of others.\n\nBut President Shukshin was different. The corporations were still terrible, he was still being paid meagerly, but things got a little better - he was able to purchase more things, the paid got slightly higher, and he saw someone in the newspaper being arrested for corruption. Nikolai knew Shukshin wasn't an angel - the Siloviki still had too much power, in his eyes, but he saw in Shukshin a man who gave a damn, who actually cared about the common person - and not in the way the hypocritical communists did, who preached about the proletarian revolution while working you to death. He was an improvement, and that alone felt positive to Nikolai. But the thing that truly made him wonder if things could get better, the thing that tore into his doubt, was when President Shukshin announced that there would be regular elections, and that all people could vote, not just the rich. For once, he felt like something good might come out of living in a nation called Russia, as a person known as Russian. For once, he could dream of a better life."

Rows of infantry held their weapons forward, boots hitting the ground in sync in perfect formation. Lines and lines of trucks carried patriotic soldiers standing at attention, their bodies as rigid as the columns of steel beasts that follow behind them. The newest batch of Russian-made tanks rumbles past, their armor shining under the sun. Uncountable amounts of artillery hug the sides of the men that haul them along as a cavalry division trots by, holding their bayonets up to the sky.\n\nShukshin gazed upon the never-ending lines of soldiers from the balcony and felt a few emotions tug at his heartstrings. Pride. Pride to the new Federation he had built, now a beacon of hope in this godforsaken world. A bit of confidence, maybe? This parade was barely a fraction of the Federation's actual army, which had become a force capable of standing up to the armies of Germany and Japan. But above all of these emotions, uncertainty. Uncertainty about the future. Would the negotiations with Japan fail? Could they beat back the Germans? What if they couldn't liberate Moscow? What if they lo-?\n\nShukshin was snapped out of his thoughts by a firm hand on his back. He looked over his shoulder and saw the concerned faces of not only his cabinet but Pokryshkin as well, his eyebrows raised with a look of concern in his eyes.\n\n"Look below, Vasily! They're all marching for you, and you're wallowing in some sort of pansy depression? Come on now, look alive! Those people are marching for you, for their President. Now act like one, yeah?" The strongman practically yelled at him. Shukshin nervously turned around, nodding. "You're right, it's just..."\n\nPokryshkin interrupted him with a loud, booming voice. "You must have faith in our nation. Faith in yourself, my friend. Do you remember the oath we made all those years ago?

Every toe was meticulously placed, lest they alert their target. From a distance, the moldering hut could have been dismissed as nothing but an abandoned dacha. But a trained eye could see the dim grey of fresh soot on the leaning, cracked chimney.\n\nThey slithered to the door of the cabin. Iosef signaled to his men. "On my mark. Three. Two. One. Mark!" Private Dragunov threw his weight into the old door, shredding it like wet paper. Iosef charged into the cabin behind him, his pistol drawn. "Put your hands up!" he screamed. "Under the orders of President Shukshin, you are under arrest." Yet as the dust cleared, Iosef saw nothing but an old man sitting on a rickety chair.\n\nThe shell of the man that was once Nikolai Bukharin had been admiring an old photograph. Those sad, worn eyes weren't the same that once burned with ideological fire. His broken gait was not the proud stride of the leader Iosef had served under so long ago. The old soldier couldn't help but blink away tears as he saw what had become of the hero he'd idolized in his youth. Once, he thought of Bukharin as a murderer, a butcher who had sent his brothers to their deaths on the hellish Caucasian front. Now, he saw only a broken man, a failure who'd lost as much as any Russian.\n\nIosef felt his pistol slip out of his hand. His fingers were suddenly numb, like he'd dipped them in snow. His throat constricted, and he felt hot tears slide from his eyes. "Nikolai Bukharin," he choked out, "for the crimes of desertion and high treason, you are under arrest." His men stood at his side, rifles trained on the former Premier of the Soviet Union. If he tried to run, then this ruin would be his final resting place.\n\nHe did not.\n\nBukharin slowly rose to his feet, prepared to face judgment for destroying Russia. He picked up the framed photo and stared at it one last time, wiping away the dust that had gathered over his former friends - and enemies. He shuffled over to Iosef, a resigned look in his sad eyes. As Iosef prepared a set of steel manacles, he heard only two words from Nikolai Bukharin, the man who had doomed three generations."

 NOV_reunification.17.desc:0 "Shukshin grabbed the latest batch of maps and laid them out on his table. His army was running short of everything, logistics was a nightmare and there weren't even enough men to fill the divisions. Shukshin slammed his fists onto the table, letting out a cry of anguish. There was no saving this disaster. The young Federation he had hoped to lead into prosperity was being strangled in its cradle, and it was all his fault. It was he who would go down in history as the third man to try to stop the Germans, the third man to fail, and the third man to doom his country once again. Was this what Bukharin had felt as the Red Army collapsed? Was this what Yegorov had felt as the partisans behind his lines destroyed any remaining chance of Suvorov succeeding?\n\nThe sound of heels frantically clacking on the floor towards his direction snapped him out of his thoughts. He turned weakly to face the door as his secretary entered the room. "Sir, the Germans are demanding our surrender! The High Command wanted you to meet with them to discuss the retreat in fifteen minutes." And with that, she quickly left, presumably to allow the President time to prepare. Shukshin felt his legs give out, suddenly dizzy.\n\nAs he grasped at the desk to get back up to his feet, a wave of nausea overcame him. Finally getting up, he grabbed the table with one hand while attempting to steady himself with the other. He felt cold beads of sweat run down his neck as the mild discomfort in his chest turned into what felt like an ice pick plunged into his heart. It was like an elephant was standing on his chest. He let the tears that had welled up in his eyes run freely down his cheeks as he clutched at his chest, trying to find some way, any way to stop the pain. Although he could see the writing on the wall, he wouldn't give up. He couldn't, not when he still had a country to lead...\n\nHowever, Shukshin could only watch as everything seemed to slow down around him. He stood there frozen, unable to move as his legs gave out again. He collapsed, first to his knees, then to the ground. He gathered what strength he had left and looked up at the flag of the country he had brought to ruin, letting out a final pained cry before closing his eyes for the last time."

The once hopeful face of Lenin's heir - nicknamed 'Golden Boy', an exemplary visage plastered on posters throughout the Soviet Union, was now depressed and ragged, creased with wrinkles and shame.\n\nShukshin signed as the former Premier met his eyes. The old man dared to look at him for only a second before his gaze returned to his dirty soles. Was he really so terrified?\n\n"I won't object to your men shooting me," the old man whispered.\n\nThe President paused, taken aback. "I didn't bring you here to shoot you," Shukshin said. "If anything, I felt living alone in that ruin was sufficient punishment. But once the Federation Council found out you were still alive, I had no choice but to honor their arrest warrant."\n\nHe stood up and looked out the window of his office. It was a beautiful day. The sun was shining; wind blew gently through jade leaves; children were playing football in the street, their lessons completed or escaped. It was not the sort of day to condemn a man.\n\n"The Federation will be a nation of laws," Shukshin said. "I can't let you go free of my own volition. The Presidency must always be subject to Russian law, not above it as the Bolsheviks once were. You'll have your day in court."\n\nBukharin nodded. "I understand."\n\nBut even then, Shukshin knew that the ex-Premier would never have justice. The Russian people knew he was guilty, even if that wasn't true. They would judge him, and an old man who'd already punished himself would rot in a cell for the rest of his short and sickly life. Was that to be his legacy? Turning Bukharin over to mob justice? Letting his people slake their thirst for revenge? Or would he give special treatment to a tyrant, the author of anarchy, the monster who'd condemned men no different than Shukshin to the gulags?\n\nWould he break the law he'd authored for the sake of mercy?"

While Shukshin wasn't tired of them - he'd gladly sit for a thousand more of these meetings if they helped liberate Russia just a bit more, he was starting to get... frustrated with his staff.\n\n"Forgive me for overstepping my expertise, gentlemen, but I've heard this same argument twice already. You have all been given instructions - clear instructions - to present your case for our general strategy for this war. Please, I want a clear and concise explanation of your strategy, and be honest about its potential downsides. This is the most important war in our nation's recent history - our failure here could doom Russia, so be modest and humble, if you would."\n\nAlexander Pokryshkin, the Siberian Falcon, stood up first as a projector displayed cellophane sheets on a screen. "As you can see, the weakness of the German lines will be reinforced, given time. If we can catch them off guard through their political turmoil, we can seize the initiative and push into a quick and easy victory. We'll utilize combined arms operations, employing our air force to great effect to match and potentially beat the Luftwaffe."\n\nAlexander Novikov, in response, stood up carefully, older than Pokryshkin as he was. "Mister President, with all due respect, I cannot endorse this type of strategy. This is the same foolish thinking the Revolutionary Front had, that a quick victory would be assured. History shows us that the Germans are tenacious, and are willing to go on counteroffensives with carefully crafted fascist partisans to fight us. We should not be so arrogant as to believe we will wipe out a world power in one fell swoop. I instead propose a careful strategy of slow advancement, with plenty of fallback lines in case their armored divisions begin tearing through our troops."\n\nMuch bickering ensued, only to be thankfully ended when Shukshin raised a hand.\n\n"Let's combine the two," he said. "A strong opening push with partisan support, and then a period of consolidation. To victory!""

His mother stood, hunched over in agony,  tears pouring down her cheeks into the copper basin of their sink.\n\n"Mama, what's wrong?" Bogdan asked.\n\nShe said nothing. Instead, Ekaterina Belyaev shook her head ferociously, and handed her son a tear stained envelope. The front, in simple type-written letters, said Federal Ministry of Defense.

"Nikolai Bukharin, you are hereby leaving this cell," Bukharin's eyes lit up - they were going to execute him - "Under house arrest, with medical supervision due to your old age." Shukshin explained. Bukharin paused for a moment as his panic grew into shock. "... You'd just let me go? Just like that?" Shukshin nodded. "You don't deserve to be free, Bukharin. Not after what you've done, after you ran away from your people, but I don't believe an old man should die in a cell. You deserve to be with your family, at least."\n\nAt that, he stepped back to reveal Svetlana Bukharina, who walked in with a soft smile on her face. "My Svetlana!"

Nikolai glanced at a smiling Shukshin, giving him a curt nod with admiration in his eyes as he held onto his daughter. Taking in that look of grace, of gratefulness for a mercy both knew Bukharin did not deserve, Shukshin left the two to their comfort, and into the crowds that'd be full of hatred for these two souls.\n\nThis was the right decision, despite the people's frustration.

Can't drink a glass of water in your own home without ingesting Sibir's runoff."\n\nEkaterina sighed in frustration as she placed the documents on the governor's desk.

My hands are tied."\n\nEkaterina cleared her throat. She put her briefcase on the Governor's desk and opened it. Inside, dozens of stacks of clean, crisp bills waiting for strong hands to fondle them. "Isn't there anything I can do to change your mind?"\n\nGovernor Evdokimov looked at the money for a long time, considering the secretary carefully. "Maybe - maybe, I said." he interrupted Ekaterina, already prepared to shake hands on a deal.\n\n"Look, I can try to fudge up something to make the Irtysh not considered major, but that won't work if Sibir doesn't keep it's runoff under control. Tell your boss I'll try to make it work if they send an application, but they actually need to keep the numbers clean, and keep them low," the Governor explained. Ekaterina jotted a few notes down and pushed the briefcase forward.\n\n"Then we have a deal. I'll handle my boss, don't worry. Ring me if we need to make edits to the application.""

After some investigating and... advanced questioning, he had learnt that the former resistance leader lived quietly.\n\n"Halt! Not one step further!" an old voice commanded from within the trees.\n\nDimitri searched around the forests before his eyes settled on an old man sitting on a sturdy branch with a rifle in his hands.\n\n"You the one roughing people up seeking to find me?" the old man asked.\n\n"I am. My name is Dimitri Ivanov. Sluzhba Bezopasnosti, here on behalf of President Vasily Shukshin of the Russian Federation. I'm here to see you, Pyotr." Dimitri replied, hands raised to show he meant no harm.\n\nPyotr lowered his rifle as he eyed Dimitri suspiciously.\n\n"Sluzhba Bezopasnosti, eh? I've heard of guys like you. Why are you bothering an old man like me?" Pyotr asked as Dmitry approached him slowly.\n\n"President Shukshin wants you to rally your old comrades in arms. Rally the people, cause problems for these Japs. The President aims to retake Birobidzhan and he believes that restarting the resistance will make the Japanese more open to negotiation with the Federation." Dimitri explained, finally lowering his hands.\n\n"President Shukshin? He's so fixated on Moscow these days, didn't think the guy cared about us here in Manchuria," Pyotr wondered aloud.\n\nHe turned away from Dimitri, thinking to himself for a moment. When Russia shattered, the NAJUA and other Russian partisans had been left to fend for themselves before the Kwantung Army finally broke them in Khabarovsk. Now the President of his homeland reunited wants him to jump into the fray. But it wasn't so easy. The people were complacent after so long, the cells tiny and defeated. Pyotr lost many of his brothers and sisters in arms in their impossible mission to free the Amur basin from Japanese rule and it amounted to nothing. But that was without a strong Russia to support them. Perhaps, this time, there would finally be a chance of success. Maybe there is a chance that he could fulfill his mission: to liberate his fellow Russians. Pyotr sighed as he turned around to face Dimitri."

Even when the West reunited, the city never recovered its former glory. It seemed that Samara's Golden Age was over.\n\nBut things changed when the Federation took over. Corporations moved into the city. Sibir. Titan. Feniks. Nikita got a better job in a reopened factory and sent his kids to a good school with the extra money. Entrepreneurs from as far as Magadan trekked to his hometown, opening new businesses and renovating unlivable apartments. New jobs and better accommodations halved the homeless population in four months.\n\nLocal elections were held throughout the city. Nikita didn't vote; he still remembered the days of KONR, when putting your name on the wrong ballot was a life-threatening mistake. But his neighbors who voted against the VRPP were still there the next day. Then, the next week. Then, the next month. Then, Nikita stopped counting the days, and realized President Shukshin was sincere.\n\nSix months later, Samara was invited to elect a member of the Duma. Nikita cast his ballot for the first time in decades with a smile on his face. In the days after, he followed the tally closely, and whooped when his candidate won. He took to reading the newspaper in the park on his lunch breaks, stuffing sandwiches into his mouth as he learned about the Federation's government. The different parties, the major figures. Alexander Pokryshkin, the Flying Ace, and Vasily Shukshin, the Peasant who became President. One month, they were butting heads over industrial projects in Kazan.

Make your presence known to him, that he may be comforted by your love."\n\n"Saint Dymphna, great wonder-worker in every affliction of mind, I humbly implore your intercession with Jesus through Mary, in this man's hour of need.

The town had been covered head to toe in Russian soldiers, as the town is now under the supervision of the Russian Federation, freed from the German rule. Andrei watched the night as German symbols got knocked down, but as he turned the corner, he heard a bloodcurdling scream, one which he could not ignore. He approached the house in which it came. As he got closer, he heard violent thumping noises from behind the closed door.\n\nAndrei lifted his foot in the air and slammed his boot onto the door, knocking it wide open. "What is going on in here?!" Andrei demanded as he looked over a brutal scene. A Russian soldier wielding a knife, stabbing into the chest of a crying woman. As he looked around the room, he saw German names, German decorations, blonde-haired individuals in photos. The home of German settlers. Even then, this brutality was... insane.\n\nAndrei wielded his gun like a bat and then smacked the Russian soldier in the face with the stock of his rifle and kicked him off the woman. "Stop, you stupid bastard!" He screamed at the soldier. "President Shukshin told you, didn't he?!" Andrei screamed at his fellow Russian. The soldier staggered in pain. "You.. you are defending the Germans! Are you sympathising with these bastards?! H-He would fire you!" The soldier responded in a fiery rage. Andrei grabbed the man forcefully and showed his face towards the bleeding woman.\n\n"Look at what you've done! Do you think this is humane?!" Andrei shouted into the soldier's face. "Shukshin told all soldiers that they are not to be brutal with the settlers! Do you want to be reported?!". Sweat rolled down the soldier's face. "A-Alright, I'll sto-" the soldier was thrown onto the floor. "Think upon your actions, as the woman you were slaughtering earlier has stopped breathing."

But, he was willing to make sure his generation would be able to not grow up in some backwater town in Siberia. He wanted to save the Russian people and the Russian homeland. To reclaim what was stolen from them by the Fascist powers that be.\n\nThinking about all he had come from, living in Novosibirsk he thought of the fledgling technocratic government shooting into the stars by controlling the anarchy around it and securing its far eastern possessions. The air now was tense and thick with a slight spattering of rain slicking down off of his boots and coating the grass in a soft dew.\n\nThe “border” itself didn't even seem imposing, it was pathetic even. In the distance, there were small outposts one could see with binoculars but other than that it was no wonder so many could get in and out so easily. Vasily thought of maybe just putting a foot over the border in a childlike notion however it was dashed as the stronger voice inside him drove him back.\n\nLeaning on a tree he looked down at his watch “14:56” it read on his arm. The time was near and the fate of Russia hung deep upon him. The countless generations gained or lost by this would be insurmountable. The history of the world would be changed as the idea of this hegemony over Europe would soon be able to be slowly taken apart"

For the briefest moment, Vasily felt an urge to comfort the man. He might have not been a part of the horrors that the Nazi's did to the rest of the country. He could have just been a worker like millions of others. For however long that sensation was, it was swiftly beaten back by the thousands of stories, fears and anxieties he had heard over the years that came to be because of the Nazi menace.\n\nVasily sooned walked away from the weeping German.

How many died, how much damage was done, are still but approximations. Despite the "official" figures offered by the Third Reich. Russian officials estimate the death toll across Caucasia in the millions, perhaps more. Anyone who has wandered through these ruins knows that an exact count is impossible. Why, just a short while ago, a little old man came and told us two children were buried in a hastily dug grave up at the end of the block. And what about these ruins? Have they gone through all of them for buried civilians, and soldiers? And what about the fourteen Azeri men we found in the courtyard behind the post office? Have they been counted? They certainly haven't been buried."\n\nThe camera pans out. Behind Cronkite, smoke is billowing from an apartment building. At least, it was an apartment building. Now it looks more akin to a tower of blocks pushed over by a frustrated toddler.\n\n"We came here, to Caucasia, to determine what all this means to the future of our world. Not since the bombing of Pearl Harbor has the barbarity and evil of National Socialist thought been so clear to the people of the Earth. The Germania line, that the Russians are in some way engaging in ethnic cleansing or a racial war against the German people, is not borne out by the evidence. In fact, it is the Russian Federation who has engaged with this war in the best tradition of mankind, as an honourable people, who lived up to their pledge to defend democracy, and did the best they could.""

Ever since the victory against the Fascist threat, he travelled to the city monthly, sometimes even every other week. On his first trip there, the city was for the most part rubble, and the buildings that remained were unrecognizable mockeries. Clearly Speer's children had been at play in the heart of their conquest. This was unacceptable; the capital of the Motherland deserved better than disfigured Nazi architecture and a crown of ruins.\n\nWithin a day of the official liberation, workers, engineers, and designers went about restoring the city, clearing away the bomb shredded walls and the cracked foundations. For the better part of a year, more than seventy percent of Moscow underwent reconstruction. In addition to houses, apartments, roads, hospitals, schools and an airport, workers installed works of art, statues, and plants, and reconstructed historical buildings under the watchful eyes of several former Decembrists. Museums, art galleries, theaters of both sorts, and multitudes of stadiums popped up on every street corner. The infamous Red Kremlin was restored and expanded, with the intention that it'd become the basecamp of the Federation's presidential and legislative bodies. Other government buildings were built in the Russian Neoclassical style. Brutalism, and the vile miasma that surrounded it, was banished from Moscow's borders forevermore.\n\nPlans for Moscow's Metro system, long abandoned, were revived with modern technology and engineering techniques. In the end, Feniks beat out Titan for the bid by a slim margin. Moscow will have a metro system that will make their opposites in Tokyo and New York blush. By the end of the decade, Moscow will be a new city- a marvel of engineering and culture, connected with its roots yet unafraid to look towards the future."

The Fascist vandals poured concrete temples and forged steel mosques, and dedicated the putrid structures to their own names. Like the Chthonic deities of the past, they demanded blood offerings. In Greece, the old gods called for spring ewes to be thrown into poisonous gorges at midnight; in Reichskommissariat Kaukasia, the dupes and the parasites demanded offerings of human flesh and blood. But just as the light of civilization banished grim Hecate from the hills of Greece, so too will the blaze of democracy and freedom burn away the foul remains of these false gods.\n\nThese mountains, these valleys, these lands that have been soaked in blood and tears will be purified of the National Socialist stain. The monuments to "Aryan ingenuity" will be smashed. The palaces and the plantations will be burnt to cinders. Their children, if they have survived, will be exiled to Germany.  The paintings, the statues, the propaganda that molders in this land will be thrown into the mud like the refuse it is. The cities will be renamed by the people's will.

Shukshin looked up to the Monument of Minin and Pozharsky, now fully restored by the Federation's finest sculptors.\n\nThe monument was created in the early 19th century during the age of the Tsars. During the battle of Moscow in 1941, Minin's face had been blown apart by a stray artillery shell intended for Saint Basil's Cathedral. Following the Great Patriotic War, the monument was made a firing range by the Wehrmacht to train their recruits to fire weapons. Vasily remembered just how horrified he had been at seeing the bullet holes that painted the front of the monument. Vasily smiled at the statues of some of Russia's finest, its scars of occupation now gone forever.\n\nVasily looked behind the statue to the Cathedral itself, which was covered in scaffolding as Russian construction workers continued working tirelessly to restore the iconic building to its former glory. "Tell me, Alexander" Shukshin spoke, getting the General's attention. "Do you ever think things will be like they were before? Before the war and the chaos? Will Germans and Russians ever greet each other as brothers?" Shukshin asked as he places a hand on the smooth stone of the monument.\n\nNovikov was silent for a moment as he thought deeply about the President's question.

We're still rebuilding Ukraine, why are we provoking another nation?"\n\nShukshin laced his fingertips. "It's not about conflict, my friend. It's about showing the people of Ukraine that we care about them, and that the Federation is fighting for their interests. Ukraine has agitated to reclaim Odessa for years.

Or was it only a memory of remembering? Sometimes, the images he conjured of those days seemed more like a flickering shadow, a mimic, not the thing itself. Still, he could remember scraps; the taste of saltwater, her hair flowing as she ran down the beach, the pain of a torn toenail. Ah, better days.\n\nThe balding man opened his photobook. It was cracked, the spine nearly shattered from continual use. Georgy flipped through the fingerprint-stained pages. First, the refugee camp he'd hidden in when the Germans seized Ukraine. Babushkas creased with age and dust, now long dead, stared back with terrified expressions. Then, a mosque in Kazan, and the nationalist rally roaring outside of it. He'd captured their rage so well. Burning trash cans and raised fists confronted the viewer, practically ready to strike them down on the spot.\n\nHe flipped past several pages. There was the unit he'd stayed with, smiling, a muscular private holding another in a headlock. Next to the photo was his boss at the propaganda ministry, cigar dangling from his mouth, his spectacles at the end of his nose as he frowned at the camera. And next to that, an image from Nikopol. Battered men and women cheering as a mixed Ukrainian and Russian unit pulled the swastika down from the flagpole at the town's center.\n\nThe Sun was starting to set. Georgy lurched to his feet, sighted the orange tinted-sky, and captured the moment for eternity. If only she was here to see it with him."

It was several months from completion, but when families heard that the new government would teach Ukrainian, parents demanded their children to head to school at the earliest convenience. Kuzma, on the other hand, had hoped to spend at least a few more weeks goofing off before having such responsibilities like ‘going to school.'\n\nHe recalled his parents stating, "not one once of german would be left in you when you finish your first year."

Right over there, in that very field, is where the battle of Poltava took place. The Russian Tsar, Peter the Great, spectacularly defeated the Swedish army and would soon afterwards start what historians have called a Russian Golden Age."\n\n"You mean this isn't the first time the town had to be rebuilt from scratch," thought Kuzma, nonetheless for once, he actually listened to the entire lecture. By the end of the day, Kuzma was called up before he could leave by the teacher. "Kuzma, I noticed that you were paying extra attention today during the history lecture. Do you find that sort of thing interesting?"  Kuzma gave a quick nod, and then the teacher reached underneath his makeshift table and pulled out a book. "Here, Kuzma, it's a book about the history of our nation, one of the first freshly printed books for the entire country, and you can get ahead of the others if you're interested in reading about it."\n\nKuzma was already glazing over whatever the teacher was saying and was looking through the book that was titled simply "The History of Russia and its People," across a solid blue cover, which had a black imprint of a Giant bear across.  He cracked the book open and immediately struggled to read the bigger words, but as soon as he saw them he knew he had to learn what it said.

But we also cannot believe that we should join the Russian's in their ‘Federation' project. Even assuming the Russians are acting in the best of faith, our nations would become no more than another one of their oblast, purely due to the size of their economy and their population. In a hundred years, the Baltic peoples would speak only Russian. People from Vilnius to Talinin would work on Moscow Time, and disperse themselves across the Federation.This is simply the reality of the situation, and many would call it prosperity."\n\n"This isn't, however, an endorsement of each nation birthing their own independent republic. That would risk ineffectual results. A desire to be truly independent and free of all national constraints is an alluring one, but consider what that means. Each republic will have to depend upon itself to maintain basic functions. Our economic recovery would slow down. We'd be much poorer than the Federation, and the scars of German rule would last longer.\n\nWhile no one argues for removing ourselves from the security arrangement we have with Russia, dependency is the death of any truly sovereign people. As such, I propose a compromise Position.\n\nOur three Republics, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, share a great deal in common. We've weathered the storms of countless invaders and rulers, and now we stand, after the greatest crime in all of history was conducted on our very land. We, who have so many dark memories and horror stories, share a common bond of unity in the face of such disasters. Our common path ties us together; if there is one thing we take into our future, let it be that shared legacy. Let us form our Confederation, guided not by Moskva but one of cooperation between our peoples. Together we can fund our roads, our schools, and our freedom.

Many opponents of accession have fears of Russian intrusion in our state; others want to depend on a tri-republic to protect our interests. Defenders of both arguments are, to put it bluntly, misguided. The Russians didn't need to march into Riga to ensure their victory. Thousands bled and died for our people to become free. Their willingness to fight demonstrates that the Russians that stepped forth into our lands are far from bloodthirsty tyrants. They're interested in our freedom, and we can see that not only in their willingness to fight for us. Look at the various Autonomous republics of Siberia. Have the Yakuts or Buryats become any less after their integration into the Russian Federation? After the autonomous republic system was fleshed out, they received funds to teach their languages, their cities reclaimed their native names, and are treated as equals. We can see that they've become active members of the Federation; many of those Yakuts and Buryats came into our nation to force the German menace out.\n\n"Here in Lithuania, we can look at the very process in action. The Russians came, and instead of forcing everyone to learn Russian, they're teaching our native tongue to our children! Furthermore, we've talked to the Russian officials; they mean to grant us even more control over our education, laws, budgets, and even government!

The gentle flow of the Baltic water was rather calming, helping the stressed President relax for a moment.\n\nEventually, Shukshin looked over his shoulder and saw a crowd of German Settlers staring at him, either with curiosity, hatred or both. The only thing stopping them was the wall of Russian soldiers, local police and the helicopters overhead that were on constant patrol.\n\nBeing in Petrograd felt strange. Vasily wasn't used to being in a land where he wasn't surrounded by his fellow Russians, Yakuts, Tatars and the like but Germans. The people that had invaded his Motherland decades ago and the people that Russia had finally beaten under the banner of the Federation.\n\nPokryshkin was heavily against him coming to Petrograd, declaring that the city would not receive him as well as Moscow or Smolensk. But of course, Vasily ignored him. He needed to see the Baltic himself. He needed to see the aftermath of everything that had happened, the consequences of the occupation. He had to see what Germany had done to Eastern Europe himself.\n\nVasily sighed as General Evseev, who had accompanied him upon hearing of the President's arrival, walked over.\n\n"President Shukshin, I would advise we leave before some of the more... radical elements of this crowd start getting any ideas" the General advised.\n\nShukshin looked over and saw several Settlers waving the red banner bearing the Swastika. Seeing the people bearing the symbols of hatred nearly broke his heart but he had to remind himself. These people's were victims of Hitler's vision as much as his people were. They had been indoctrinated by the Nazi party and bred to hate. Vasily could only hope that with time, Hitler's legacy could finally be undone.\n\nVasily finally nodded and the older General escorted him to the car."

You did well, my friend. Eastern Europe is free and that is all that matters. I know you're the President but as your friend, I'm ordering you to go get some sleep. Because of you, The Federation is stronger than ever. I'm sure it can handle you resting for a few hours."\n\nShukshin was silent for a moment, smiling before standing up.\n\n"Alright, Alexander.

Shukshin briefly looked down at the rubble at his feet.\n\n"We can't just tear down centuries of history, Amet. Moscow was the whole reason we fought and won this war. That was how we rallied our men. That's how we consoled the widows and crying mothers of those fallen. That was our will to fight. To take back Moscow. We can't forsake our duty to all the people who died along the journey just because it doesn't look pleasing right now. Rebuilding takes time." Shukshin stoically responded.\n\nThe pair continued to walk, seeing beggars in the streets and beleaguered citizens shamble along carrying groceries. Sultan spoke up once again. "Why can't we build something new? Something exciting? Have you seen those American cities? They have tall office buildings everywhere and can support a modern economy."\n\n"There's more than enough cities where plans like those can be implemented. But the idea of Moscow, and more importantly the people of Moscow, deserve better than what those cities can provide. Think about how many people would be forced from their homes if we let developers come in and buy up all the land to make office space. No, Moscow's prestige needs to be kept and its people put first," President Shukshin responded.\n\n"I suppose you're right. I'm glad you're taking the current residents of Moscow into consideration, Vasily. Russia should be a place where people of all backgrounds can live in harmony." Sultan enthusiastically said.\n\nThe pair rounded the corner into Red Square. In the distance, scaffolding covered the domes of St. Basil's Cathedral. The structure would be restored to how it was in the days before the occupation. It would serve as the centre of Moscow's skyline, and would signify to the world that Russia was finally back."

At the end of her service as a sniper during the Second West Russian War, the state summoned her to fulfill her duty once again. But this time, she wouldn't be behind a Mosin's scope, but a teacher's desk.\n\nArina could only think of her childhood in Tomsk as she prepared to leave her apartment. She remembered countless days running through the snow drifts outside her home, sprinting down the path to school with a song in her heart. She'd fallen in love with the idea of teaching before she could spell. But then came the wars, the anarachy, the misery. In truth, she'd ended up on the wrong side of the Siloviki's sights when they fought the Republic. It was only the desperation of the period before the reclamation war began that let her pick herself off the streets.\n\nArina shivered as she marched out of her modest apartment. A worried sigh escaped her lips. Was it even possible? A second chance... it seemed almost impossible.\n\nA stocky man stood on a ladder next to the elementary school's door, paintbrush in hand, rewriting the school's name in Cyrillic. Arina couldn't help but admire the dandelion yellow building in the imperial style. It was a meager facsimile of the gymnasiums of old- but function came before splendor, especially in times like these. "Colonel Voronkova!" The painter practically jumped off his ladder as he rushed to greet her. "What a blessing! I've been demanding that the government send us a real teacher for months. The children, bless them, hardly know how to ask for a biscuit in Russian. I've tried, by God I've tried, but-"\n\n"Sir." Arina cut him off, straightening her back into a parade rest. "There's no time for hysterics. Show me inside."\n\nThe principal showed Arina to the classroom.

Immense convoys laden with every kind of supplies thundered down the town's dusty roads. A squadron of men in business suits parked outside the historical center. Their assistants set up tents and unpacked reams of paperwork.\n\nIt wasn't long before Young Georgy approached. His nickname was a joke, of course; he was nearing forty-five, muscular and balding, with calloused hands and a dark tan born of years in the fields.

For a while, Novikov believed the city could never be rebuilt. Yet as he looked around the thriving Kremlin, native Muscovites posing for pictures at the gate, he couldn't be happier to be wrong.\n\nOf course, Moscow was only the first step in the Federation's reconstruction efforts. Most of Western Russia's great cities, including Smolensk, Tver, Tula, Ryazan, Voronezh and many, many others were still struggling to recover from decades of damage. There were some under his command who believed trying to restore what remained of Western Russia was a futile effort. They thought it easier to knock down these Russian achievements and rebuild from scratch.\n\nPerhaps once, Novikov would have agreed. But after seeing what they'd accomplished in Moscow, he couldn't help but scoff at the idea.  If the Great City of Moscow could reclaim its former glory, then the entirety of Western Russia could easily do the same!\n\nWestern Russia shall find its golden age once more, he thought. Soon enough, the memories of glories past would be restored to today.

 NOV_postwar.66.desc:0 "In a country often viewed as incredibly impoverished, Russia has started to experience a genuine change in fate. In what many economists have begun to call "the miracle on the Volga", the Russian economy has begun to flourish due to many factors. For one, Russian businesses have regained access to the core Russian heartland, meaning many more customers and opportunities for expansion and development. Following the war, the Russian Federation turned the billions stored for the armed forces into economic growth to develop and encourage new and old industries coupled with a massive amount of infrastructure development. A particular example that demonstrates Russia's resolve into developing into a true superpower is its investments in advanced technologies.\n\nThat example is the New Millenia program, which aims to turn the Russian Federation into a juggernaut of electronic development. Currently, the program is intended to develop standardized systems and teach up to a million by 1980 in various aspects of computer science development. The New Millenia is but one programme; other programmes have targeted automobiles, heavy machinery, and consumer goods. These programmes have been coupled with an aggressive infrastructure development plan, making the travel of goods easier than any other point in Eurasian history.\n\nIn addition to new industries, the Russian Federation has taken an active approach to focus on the developing parts of the economy that the global economy lacks, rather than broadly developing industries across all sectors. What made this sharp focus possible was the coordination between the Russian Government under President Shukskin, the Major Companies of Russia, and the rapidly growing ‘middle class.'  The reason cited by the economic ministry is that Russia rests now in a crucial place where it has sufficient resources to develop important sectors of the economy and maintains decent relations with the Sphere and warm relations with the OFN. Additionally, with Germany's defeat, the rest of Europe is eager to start trading with the Russian Giant and escape the german influence. The result of this position is a massive power able to take part in most of the major world markets, taking the best from each and using that knowledge and access to build a life beyond what most Russians believed was possible just a decade ago."

Her job was to bomb the place, lighten the defences up so Ivanov and the boys could clean up the mess. After a few minutes, the farm was finally in sight. She flicked a switch, composing herself as she activated her comms.\n\n"Colonel Ivanov, this is Captain Anna. I'm approaching now. Tell the boys to get their toys ready".\n\n"Copy that, Captain. Ready to move when ready," Dmitri Ivanov replied.\n\nAnna dove down sharply towards the farm, unloading the payload of explosives. She looked over her shoulder as she watched the flames ascend to the skies. The farmhouse and barn were torn to pieces. She sighed as she took to the skies once more. Why are the Germans forcing them to do this? She activated her comms once more, contacting the strike team on the ground."

Entrepreneurs, managers, and Siloviks sat elbow to elbow at the mahogany conference table- and not all were part of the Feniks team. Yes, there was Aleksandr Belov, CEO of Feniks Infantry Solutions. And yes, there sat Deniska Baladin of Feniks Tractor and Machinery Supply with that stupid smile on his face. But across the table sat Roman Levitsky, COO of Titan Research and Development, and Sergei Novlischev, CGO of Sibir Community Lending. Each of them was just a cog in the machine. But their presence represented something more: an alignment of the megacorporations on the crucial issue of profit.\n\n"If you'll turn to page three, we can begin the executive summary of Fenik Extractive's findings," Langemak said. "Extractive's prospectors presented data indicating significant deposits of gold, uranium, oil, and fluorspar throughout the Mongol countryside. Due to the incompetence of the Kalgan government, and massive resistance from socialist militias and nomad tribesmen, these items are almost universally unexploited."\n\n"I doubt the Mongols will just let us waltz in and take them," Belov said.

I haven't heard anything about this," he said.\n\n"In light of the Federation's orientation away from the Co-Prosperity Sphere, Feniks has devised a strategy to access the Mongol market, and through it a broad East-Asian consumer base," Langemak said. "We intend to take advantage of the instability in the Mengjiang region to empower rebellious liberal elements, as well as restless tribal groups. By arming and supplying the opposition, the Federation will find itself in an optimal negotiating position to obtain favourable trade agreements in a newly born state isolated from its neighbours." "And how do you intend to convince the President and his stooges in the Federation Council?" Levitsky asked. Langemak simply smiled. "The President's a bleeding heart.

When his unit was appointed to deal with a "Werwolf" problem in Moscow, he knew the drill. Many of his superiors objected to his method of trying to find the ring leader instead of breaking up smaller cells, but Morozov believed that cutting off the head of the snake was more efficient than cutting off its tail.\n\nAnd his methods eventually bore fruit. After a while of listening on wiretaps, collecting info from informants and some "enhanced" interrogation sessions, the Spetsnaz finally located the leader of the Moscow chapter. They tracked the leader to an unassuming house in the outskirts of the city, which belonged to a certain "Boris Ignatyev" also known as "Garmr" to his Werwolf allies. In the middle of the night, Morozov and his men stormed the lonely house, determined to take "Garmr" dead or alive. Unfortunately for them, the house was seemingly deserted, until one of the Spetsnaz discovered a hidden door behind a bookcase. It was hastily opened, and the door opened to a staircase that lead to a secret basement. The unit went down into the basement to discover a makeshift operations room, filled with maps, documents and weapons. The Spetsnaz discovered a man attempting to use the radio to send messages in German, possibly to warn his Werwolf allies that he's been discovered. A voice in Russian yelled at him to stop and turn around slowly with his hands up. Instead of complying, the man tried to pull a gun on the Spetsnaz; and within seconds, "Garmr" was dead.\n\nThe Spetsnaz and Russian intelligence agents combed through the documents found and discovered that they've stumbled upon treasure. The man that they killed wasn't named "Garmr" or "Boris" but named "Lutz Hoffmann", an agent of the German Abwehr, tasked with organizing the Moscow chapter of the Werewolves. With the intelligence gathered at Hoffmann's headquarters the Russians found out about every cell, every safehouse,  every supply route, and every planned attack. The next few weeks saw a crackdown of epic proportions. Hundreds of German Werewolves dead and thousands more taken prisoner.

It made him uneasy, thinking about how horrible the place was before they showed up. Despite this, he'd heard tales from some soldiers stationed in other neighbourhoods; about how a lot of Belarusians didn't enjoy having their houses blown up. But he's just a private, he thought, so Anton didn't worry too much about anything like that happening. He could just direct them to his superiors and watch the shitshow unfold. He cracked a wry grin as the thought passed through his mind.\n\nHe passed through the city, essentially off-duty, but still wearing his military fatigues and carrying his rifle. With the reconstruction going on, he must be alert at all times, or so the commanders tell him. Anton thought the city was doing just fine, especially considering how happy the people seemed to be at the Germans being kicked out. As he thought all of this, a scent wafted by him, something warm and impossibly comforting. He immediately followed the scent down the street, checking each corner and alleyway and passing by several soldiers eating the very thing he craved out of massive bowls. His stomach began to rumble; whether or not he was hungry before, he sure was now.\n\nEventually, he arrived at what initially appeared to be a meager stall, with an old man, probably in his 60's or 70's, and a young woman. Around the stall sat many soldiers, once again eating the same delight Anton had been looking for. Without hesitation, he approached the stall, noting the gargantuan pots and pans with delicious concoctions cooking inside them."

 NOV_postwar.91.desc:0 "Several men stood around the refurbished presidential desk that sat in the renovated Kremlin. The table was fairly eccentric, far from the one that the President had used previously, but his advisors swore for days that the table needed to match the new prestige that the President of the Russian Federation held. It didn't need to be this way, but statements backed by action were the quickest way to restore the Russian spirit and power globally. Russia was back on the world stage, and it wasn't going to waste time proving it. As such, it was only natural that one of the first conversations over that desk was what to do with China.\n\n"The Ma's are, as you know, a political faction within Northwestern China; they've held out for decades against Japanese pressure and harbour interest to overthrow the Japanese. Furthermore, they're ideologically varied but not stringent on any particular beliefs. The Ma's are classical Kuomingtang believers, especially the current leader, Ma Jiyuan; ideally, they want democracy and develop China, meaning nothing we would want or suggest to them would be outside of their wheelhouse. In short, they're malleable to our interests and needs, and we can trust they'll be willing to cooperate with us. Especially if we give them enough support that Western China will fall under their rule." When the Chinese Intelligence division department head finished, he looked to the others before finally stopping on the President, waiting to see if the President had any questions to ask.\n\nthe president slouching in his chair uttered in an exhausted tone. "Well, obviously, we're going to meet with them, but beyond that, what can we expect?"\n\n"Western China is far from a kind place, and it's unlikely that even united it could overthrow the Sphere. Nonetheless, it can serve as a thorn, and if given the right resources and the right crisis, they could swing eastward and establish their regime. Even if they don't liberate the rest of China anytime soon, having a state between us and the heart of the Sphere that is aligned with us would help us wonderfully. We can build up another market that our businesses can work in, strengthen our image globally, bolster our security, and hopefully make a long-term ally. In short, it's an all-around beneficial idea to help them develop and take over the region, especially if we're planning on a longer-term confrontation with the Sphere."\n\nThe president started to fix his sitting position only to utter all the words he needed to, "In that case, then you can get to work with the KMT, send an envoy and start sending supplies along with advisors and support. How long will it take for the Ma's to take all of Western China outside of Japanese rule?""

Beneath the flag, several men with a fair bit dusty but relatively new uniforms stood. Initially, the Chinese soldiers prepared for the worse, aiming their old rifles at the convoy of armored cars. The Chinese lowered their weapons only when Rustam had ordered the soldiers to pull out the Russian flags.\n\nWhen the Russians finally got to the crossing of Chinese soldiers,  a terse set of glances were exchanged, only to be broken up by Rustam's Mandarian, supposedly the best the Federation had to offer. The Chinese soldiers struggled to follow but understood what the Tartar and the rest of the Russian detail were here for; they were to meet Ma Jiyuan.\n\nThe Local Chinese officer offered to take them to Jiyuan personally and joined the Russians on their trip. Rustum used the officer to brush up on the local variant of Mandarin and was taken aback by how nasal the pronunciation of Chinese words were. The two became fast friends, much to the detriment of the driver, who would spend the rest of the trip listening to the two sharing details and information about the Chinese Language. The two didn't even notice when they finally arrived at the center of the Ma Clique."

The second he arrived, he was separated from his new Chinese friend and was taken to what he understood to be a government building. One of the local men asked Rustam to wait a moment in one of the rooms, of which he was happy to oblige; he was beyond tired after the long trip and needed to movement to refocus his mind.\n\nThe room itself was a fair bit bland. It had a window, a bed, a table, a few chairs, and a classical Chinese painting on the wall depicting a mountainside. For a moment, Rustam was disappointed, but Rustam was quick to reprimand himself. Only a few years ago did Russia look like this, but despite it, not only did the Federation pull itself up, it stood up to the Germans and came out victories. The Chinese can do the same, especially if given the right push.\n\nA few minutes passed, and finally, a freshly dressed officer appeared outside his doorway and announced that Ma Jiyuan was finally to meet with the Russian envoy. To Rustam's surprise, Ma Jiyuan was far more plane-looking than he expected. He proudly wore his military uniform, with bright and clean Kuomingtang symbols. But the eyes he had betrayed both his sadness and strength. Jiyuan had been fighting longer than most Russians had; it was clear that for him, the war never ended. The first words he heard uttered were not bold promises but an apology.\n\n"I'm sorry for not preparing adequately for your arrival, but we didn't have much clue of when you would be arriving or from what direction; therefore, we haven't prepared food or any of the etiquette fit for a representative of your nation."\n\nRustam was quick to affirm the general, "Please, you needn't worry. I grew up in a Russia that was being bombed regularly. I understand your position and difficulty perfectly, so you needn't apologize. The one thing I can tell you without a shadow of a doubt is that we understand your struggle, and that is why we're here to help. I'm to become the permanent representative of the Russian Federation to your government. Furthermore, I'm here to inform you numerous supplies and support are to come to assist you and your government in the reclamation of China, starting with the west."\n\nMa Jiyuan seemingly had weights taken off his shoulders when the admission of aid was uttered. It might have been cold calculus in Moscow or genuine interest in rebuilding China, but for once, in his life; he felt maybe China had a true friend."

Ali cleared his throat, getting the Armenians attention. Gurgen looked away from the map, staring the man in the eye for a moment.\n\n"Hello, I'm Gurgen Zanikjan. I'm the de facto head of the resistance. I presume you're with Russian intelligence?" the Armenian asked as he shook Ali's hand. "Ali Gasimov.

I must confess, I didn't expect the Russians to send... well, your people to deal with us" Gurgen stated as he took a seat and sat down at the table. The tension in the room was palpable. Despite their isolation, the storm of rivalry that has endured for centuries was seemingly ready to roar at any second. Ali sighed, looking over to the flag of Armenia that hung proudly on the wall.\n\n"Truthfully, Gurgen. I didn't want to be here" Ali began. "When they asked me to come here and negotiate the alliance between Armenia and the Federation, I wanted to say no but..." Ali paused for a moment. He wondered what his ancestors would think of him?\n\nNone of that mattered right now. There were bigger things than that. Regardless of what he thought about Armenia, one thing was certain. It did not deserve to be massacred and burned to ash but the Turkish and the insanity that is the Grey Wolves. He may be a son of Azerbaijan, but he refused to stand by and allow this injustice against the Armenians to continue any longer.\n\n"There are bigger things than the rivalry between our two peoples. We have both endured the evils of imperialism. Azerbaijan, thankfully, has been liberated from those who would have sought to annihilate our nation, just as the Turkish wish to do to you. If we want our people to survive these difficult times, we have to put aside our differences and work together" Ali explained, turning away from the flag and looking back at the man in the chair. The room was quiet for a moment before Gurgen slowly began to nod.\n\n"You're right. There are bigger matters than the rivalry between our peoples. I'm willing to set it aside for the sake of freedom. I believe we have business to discuss. Please, take a seat" Gurgen said with a smile, gesturing to the available chair.

It was another night, for Davit... if that was something to find pride in, now. His hands, calloused and scarred, gripped firmly along the edge of the photo. Its dusty, black-and-white colouration was illuminated by the flickering flame in front of him, with the smudged little figures only slightly visible.\n\nHis eyes quietly drifted along the front, eyes looking upon those grainy little figures. He'd seen this sight perhaps a thousand times over, now- had sat aside this campfire over and over again, after days worth of fighting. His thumb, running softly along the side of the photo, ever slightly ruffled its dirty white edges. He could still remember their voices, occasionally. Could remember their smiles- their laughter, even in the face of their circumstances before. Their youth..that which was stolen from them. Perhaps, back then they'd have been here, sitting by his side. Perhaps, he wouldn't have had to be the only one left- perhaps there could've been some hope, for the future of their people. They'd called themselves Fedayi for a reason- 'those who sacrifice'. That was not the case, for him.\n\nAnoush, Tigran, Arax..all gone, now.\n\nHe'd fought for so long, now..since he was a young boy. He'd fought for Armenia, yet- he had yet to die for Armenia. He'd lost his friends, his family...he'd lost what made it anything to him. His teeth, under the scraggly beard that adorned his face, were tightly grit. The feelings within him, he could not describe- a concoction of rage and hurt. Was this his fate? To fight forever, for the sake of a people that he could never feel the joys of?\n\nHe would either die or be alone. Either meet his end, or, by some means- kill, and kill, and kill, until he finally stood alone, atop a mountain of corpses with which nobody else to finally appreciate the view. What could be won here? Would it ever be worth it?\n\nDavits face, pampered with dust and soot, had been disturbed by the solemn flow of red-hot tears. There was no means of controlling it, anymore- nothing to hold him back. He missed them, he missed his family-he damned every god possible and damned the Turk.

Where the hell had it all gone so wrong? Was it when Shukshin had initially taken over the Federation, or was it even earlier? Yet he also told himself that it didn't matter. Mistakes or no, they had to live with the consequences and try and fix whatever they could.\n\nAlexander stood up from his desk and walked over to the Presidential portrait of his late friend. He had that signature smile on his face, and he could recall how he had joked to Shukshin earlier that morning about how he looked like a movie star. Now, he would never see that smile in person ever again.\n\n"How can I do this without you in my ear, Vasily?" Alexander joked, a small smile appearing on his face as he couldn't help but find a bit of humor in how ludicrous he found this whole situation to be. Yet it quickly faded away. Pokryshkin knew that his few friends feared for his mental health as of late. Vasily's death and the seemingly endless accusations that he had sabotaged the war effort and murdered the President were all taking a toll on him. That he had betrayed his closest friend.\n\n"At least you were spared from this, Vasily. I would rather take the blame for everything that happened than for your legacy to be tarnished in death," Pokryshkin muttered as he slowly walked over to the window that presented him with a view of Novosibirsk, a city that looked more gray and sad with each passing week since the defeat. Would this be all that remains of everything he and Vasily had worked so hard to build? "This can't be the end," Alexander whispered. "I will make things right again, Vasily," he proclaimed as he looked back towards the portrait, his friend smiling back at him."

It was a loaf of bread and a few toppings, like ham, cheese and the such. "Cut the loaf of bread carefully," Grigory carefully explained. "This is supposed to last us until I get paid next, which is in about a week." The children looked disappointed, while his wife just looked despondent.\n\n"So... we are living like this again?" Natalya said, pulling back on the bag to take a look herself. She heard Grigory sigh, and felt a small bit of warmth spread through her body as she felt his hands sift through the back of her hair.\n\n"Yes. It won't be as bad as how it was years back, but… it's still definitely bad," Grigory replied. He leaned over to give his wife a kiss on her head, before continuing. "Natalya, I wish we could raise these children into normal lives. It looked promising, didn't it?" Grigory said.\n\nNatalya hung her head down. "Yeah. I thought President Shukshin would deliver... some kind of justice," Natalya remarked. "But all he did was fail.".\n\n"The situation just continues to get worse. I'm getting less and less pay from my job. I don't know how we're going to feed the children," Grigory said, with a hollow feeling spreading in his heart. The two children would have to eat bread on very thin slices. They would complain throughout the day of being hungry, but the parents couldn't do anything, as they didn't want to waste their weeks worth.\n\nAs night came around, the entire family was turning the lights off, their stomachs rumbling and yearning for food, but they couldn't waste it. It was supposed to last the week."

A mere puppet of the party he supposedly led? But that was not what most caused Alexander anguish right now. Pokryshkin's thoughts returned to Shukshin, who still rotted away in some jail God knows where.\n\nPokryshkin had been prohibited from even seeing the man, Glinka threatening to shoot Shukshin himself if he were to even try. He can't imagine what his old friend was going through right now. Stuck in a damp cell, watching as everything that you built was torn apart right before your eyes. To see the nation you worked hard to build fall apart, unable to do anything to prevent it from happening.\n\nPokryshkin sat down at his desk, his head resting in his hands. He hated this feeling. He despised being forced to do his own party's bidding in order to keep his best friend alive. Alexander remembered how much he and Shukshin bickered over the future of the Federation. How the two would end up sharing a drink, regardless of whatever argument that came up before.\n\nAlexander clenched his fists, his knuckles turning white as his face became red with anger. How could he have allowed the members of his party to gain such leverage over him? He won't let this continue. He won't leave his friend to rot, he couldn't. He would beat the Siloviki and retake control of his life. He would do it not for himself but for Russia and her people. For his friend's dream. For all of Russia."

 NOV_failure.15.desc:0 "Pokryshkin entered his old Presidential office alone. Moments ago, he had just been inaugurated as President of the Federation for the second time in his life. Alexander walked over to his desk but stopped when he saw the chair. He stared at the seat where Vasily Shukshin once sat. This didn't feel right, none of this felt right. It wasn't supposed to have happened this way.\n\nHe closed his eyes, thinking back to a time when he and Shukshin were sharing a drink as they watched the broadcast of a hockey game between the Russians and Canadians. It was the first time in decades that Russia had competed overseas in a sporting event. The Russian team winning made that night truly one to remember. The office had been filled with laughter when one of the Canadian players shot wide, quickly followed by cheers when the Russians brought the puck across the rink and shot it straight into the net. It was a good memory of better times.\n\nNow, he had nothing. Shukshin is gone now. Russia had lost to the Germans for the third time in what was perhaps their last chance at driving the fascists from their lands. The liberation of Russia and the dreams of a Federation lay in tatters under Nazi boots, trampling all hope. He knew that this room wasn't the only one in Russia now filled with a hopeless anxiety about the future. But he could change that.\n\nAlexander opened his eyes as he finally took a seat. He had to move on. He was the President now and the Federation was seemingly on the verge of breaking. Pokryshkin sighed as he looked out the window that revealed the vast cityscape of Novosibirsk. The Federation needed a President to lead it through this difficult time and Alexander was the only man who could do so."

"To put it bluntly, doesn't look good, General Secretariat."\n\n"Might not look good, but it's all problems we can counter, comrade." Chulkov said as he picked up a folder and inspected it. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw his advisor looking around the room, with particular interest on a certain picture frame. It showed a young man, no older than 30, in a white naval outfit with a peaked cap and the hammer and sickle stamped proudly on it. A smile of pure confidence painted his face.\n\nThe advisor pointed to the picture frame. "Who is this?" He asked, turning back towards his boss.\n\nChulkov looked at him with a faint smile. "Ah, my friend. He was a hero of the people," Chulkov explained. "I was under his command many years ago. He was a personal idol to me! He led Buryatia through the worst of times."\n\nThe advisor turned his head, confused. "Sounds like a great man," He asked. "Why isn't he here today?" He saw Chulkov's face immediately turn into a frown. The advisor's eyes widened, noticing the downcast look.\n\n"Well," Chulkov answered, "he's 6 feet underground. That's all I'll tell you. But," Chulkov said as he put his hand on the advisor's shoulder, "I'm sure he'd be looking down from the heavens proud at our glorious revolution! Now, we must immediately start working towards making our worker's paradise in the Far East, and one day reclaim Russia one by one!"\n\nDespite his outward confidence, Chulkov couldn't shake his strong sense of doubt that had nestled itself deep within him. He sometimes believed he was weak. He was scared of his legacy, and he was scared of the future.

 NOV_bill.1.t: "The Representation Act Passes!"
 NOV_bill.1.desc: "Democracy is built upon the will of the people, and this cannot be expressed solely through the executive office. For it to survive, it must guide the government and be unhindered by unelected policymakers, and this is exactly what our new government has accomplished.\n\nIn a monumental vote within the Duma, the first piece of major legislation since the start of President Shukshin's administration has passed handily through the government. With an end to state-appointed deputies within the Federal Assembly, the Silovik stranglehold on our nation is foundationally checked for the first time since the Federation's birth. Our Duma has been utterly transformed, now elected by the people and run with their interests placed first. It cannot be said this bill ends our work removing the influence of the Siloviki of course, but with it comes the assurance the President's work cannot be so easily undone should he lose in coming elections.\n\nAs a consequence of our victory, the Federation has already begun to see renewed political expression on a scale not seen for decades. New parties and groups already fill the halls of government from all walks of the ideological spectrum. The days of a one party state and a regulated opposition will never return, as in its place stands a pluralist and free political system, shaping the nation's future forevermore."

 NOV_bill.2.desc: "Jubilant celebrations and muted protests have broken out all across the Federation as Vasily Shukshin yet again pushes his increasingly-idealistic vision of Russian democracy forward.\n\nAimed at targeting Silvoki-enforced electoral restrictions stretching back to the dissolution of the CSR, the Voting Rights Act is yet another step forward in the goal of unraveling the corporate state propagated under the former President. Polling stations will be administered locally, no longer under the "required protection" of arms. Minorities, Socialists, and other previously-deemed "security risks" under the Anti-Narodnik laws will be whitelisted from search, and save for already-convicted felons and criminals, all will be granted participation in their natural birthright to vote.\n\nThe VRPP may contest us on the grounds of "elective overreach" and "jeopardizing electoral integrity", but there will be no great reversal. Vasily Shukshin has put pen to paper, and his next chapter has only just begun."

Today, our Federation has started the process of escaping such social strangleholds, and the women of Russia can finally begin to breathe free.\n\nOur recent legislation aimed at ending unequal treatment for women has been firmly passed into law by the Duma with the help of our coalition. New programs and regulations to end discrimination in the schoolhouse, workplace, and government office will be implemented across the Federation in short order. Such a shift in social norms cannot happen overnight, but with strict enforcement of the new law significant change is likely to be seen over the coming months, setting the Federation on a path towards more equal treatment of its people.\n\nOf course, this may go over less than smoothly with Russia's more conservative constituents, but our success provides a major boost to the President's popularity among the more progressive-minded, most of all the women of the Federation. For better or worse, the direction of the nation has been set firmly towards that of further equity, with no signs of stopping."

The Duma has finally acted on this injustice and taken a major step to see it end.\n\nAfter weeks of negotiation and President Shukshin personally pressing the issue, the Environmental Protection Act was finally signed into law. Strong regulations on industrial waste products, air pollution, and clean water will finally check corporate destruction of nature across the Federation. There is still much to be done in saving the natural beauty of the Federation, but a major victory has been won for the country and the President, a strong advocate of environmental regulation since the earliest days of his government.\n\nThe EPA has already received resounding approval from the public, even among more conservative voters, giving our government a strong mandate to enforce its provisions strictly. The VRPP has expressed its discontent with the harsh restrictions imposed by the legislation, but with such strong public support the Siloviki have remained quieter than usual. All in all, a great success has been achieved as the Federation begins to breathe freely once again."

Vasily Shukshin's violent campaign of de-corporatization and "protection" of the Federation's "natural beauty" has severely affected not just our profit margins, but our image among society as a whole.\n\nThe VRPP only has Russia's best interests in mind. The youth, pliable as they are, have been molded by corrupt, disingenuous propaganda aimed at destroying everything Mr. Pokryshkin achieved during his great tenure in office.\n\nThe "Environmental Protection Act" is a thinly-veiled attempt at curtailing our ruthless ambition through stagnant bureaucracy, and in the Land of the Strong there is no room for such restrictive, harmful and anti-corporate measures. While thousands have already taken to the streets in mindless "protests", we will not be victims of intimidation.

The Federation has faced its economic jailwardens and made a resolute decree: No more.\n\nIn a revolutionary vote with the help of the whole of our coalition, the Federal Assembly has passed the Corporate Limitation Act into law, issuing comprehensive and widespread regulation targeting monopolies and corporate overstep. The bill includes several provisions against Feniks and Titan directly, as well as less harsh restrictions on Sibir, all aimed at freeing the market and allowing businesses outside the corporate sphere of influence to prosper and grow without being unfairly run out of the economy.\n\nThe vast majority of our voter base has celebrated the bill with overwhelming enthusiasm, especially among the small business owners of Russia and those most fervently against corporate control. The VRPP has expressed its dissatisfaction, of course, but with such non-partisan support for the bill, its passing proved to be inevitable. Today marks a turning point in Russia's history, with the oligarchy of the past left behind in place of a free and prosperous economy."

Long hours and horrible conditions were all too common, all for the sake of corporate profits. Its human impact was almost incalculable, especially with the extremism and violence of the Narodniks, which could only have been fostered under such conditions. These laws intended to keep the Federation strong did nothing but make it suffer, but today the President has begun to heal the scars inflicted on the nation.\n\nAfter a long voting session, the Federal Assembly has passed the Worker's Protection Act, including sweeping and monumental reforms to the workplace across Russia. A stronger minimum wage, protections for unions, and improved workplace safety all were mandated in one of the largest pieces of legislation since the start of Shukshin's presidency.\n\nRussia has broken out into celebration and praise of the bill, with non-partisan support from across the whole of the nation. Likewise, the governing coalition has shared a rare moment of true unity and common triumph over the Act's passing, while the VRPP remains almost entirely silent as it doesn't dare to anger such a large portion of its voting base.

The Federation's corporate-dominated healthcare system has harmed its people for decades, but today that legacy taints our government no longer.\n\nAfter a tense series of discussions with the Siloviki of the VRPP, the Federal Assembly has passed our jointly-authored constitutional amendment. The newly mandated policy includes a strong and robust national healthcare system for treating the most pressing and dire diseases and illnesses, but maintains a regulated private system outside such circumstances. A new public sector has already begun to be established as the existing private system adapts to its newly limited area of control.\n\nResponse to the legislation has been somewhat mixed, with supporters of the DSPR calling the amendment not nearly enough to fix the Federation's previously broken healthcare system, and some in the VRPP decrying it as still too extreme. The public is broadly approving of the amendment, importantly among conservatives as the budget remains in a far more reasonable position compared to what the proposals of the DSPR would have pushed it to. Like any compromise, no one is entirely pleased, but the Federation is undoubtedly in a much safer and healthier place."

The Federation's corporate-dominated healthcare system has harmed its people for decades, but today that legacy taints our government no longer.\n\nAfter a series of compromises and negotiations within our coalition, our joint constitutional amendment with Leonid Kantorovich's Democratic Socialists has finally been passed by the Federal Assembly. With its adoption, a robust national healthcare system, free of corporate influence or greed, is now mandated by the highest law of the Federation. Private insurance and any corporate power over the nation's well being is all but defunct as coverage extends to the vast majority of healthcare costs.\n\nA large share of our voter base has celebrated the success of the legislation, along with the supporters of the DSPR, but the amendment has proved to be divisive among the more conservative in Russia. The cost of such a wide-reaching system is no doubt high, but the full effect of the amendment on the budget will likely not be seen for some time. Nonetheless, the monetary cost cannot outweigh the human cost of inaction, and the Federation will recognize this as the benefits of the new system reveal themselves to the public."

 NOV_bill.10.desc: "In the early days of President Shukshin's first term in office, the RAPP reached an agreement to pass a sweeping constitutional amendment instituting a national healthcare system; however, in the years since, it's become clear this legislation, while important and deeply beneficial to the Federation's people, did not go nearly far enough. Many Russians still failed to receive adequate medical aid, particularly in regions lacking the infrastructure to support it, but today this has begun to be remedied.\n\nThe Federal Assembly has resoundingly passed the President's new Federal Insurance Act, giving Russia a renewed budget for the public healthcare sector and increased coverage for underlooked areas like dentistry and optometry. Rural medical infrastructure has also seen a major boost, helping to increase access to pre-existing aid and better the lives of the Federation's most underlooked sick and poor.\n\nThe public and opposition within the Duma has generally approved of the bill, if more mutedly than some of our previous legislation, albeit with rural areas seeing a stronger reception. While by no means revolutionary, a significant flaw in the Federation's healthcare system has been mended, and the country continues to prosper."

Despite attempting to align with smaller independent groups and organizations, a wall of fierce resistance from both extremes of the Duma whittled down our alliance vote-by-vote, stymieing any hopes of a clear majority through ruthless, yet effective legislative politicking.\n\nThis setback has substantially reduced our population's faith in the RAPP's grandiose dreams, driving support towards opposition parties on both ends of the political extreme. While this isn't a fatal blow for President Shukshin's administration, it will take a significant effort to restore Russia's trust in his vision for the future."

Our failure to repeal the  Environmental Protection Act through democratic means is an untold embarrassment not seen since the election of Vasily.\n\nThe executives are angry, our support base is waning, and thousands of disgusting rioters now campaign on the streets for Primakov's removal from office.

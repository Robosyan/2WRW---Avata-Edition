 unification_war.1.t:0 "Dust to Dust"
 unification_war.1.desc:0 "The walls of the hastily-constructed refuge shook with every thump of shellfire. Stacked logs and rebar chipping off in the monotony of the blasts.\n\nFyurer Vagner sat slumped against his wooden seat, sweat dripping from his forehead and pattering down onto the assembled table below. The last remaining warriors of the Brudershaft stood at his side, carrying vintage STG's and scavenged Kalashnikov's coupled with patched-together uniforms made out of torn fabric and tarp. This was the last stronghold of the born-again Aryans. The resting place of a Brotherhood forged in the blood and marrow of the "weak".\n\nThe shriveled figure of what once was the "Savior of the Slavo-Aryan Spirit" now barely fit the makeshift officers uniform wrapped around his aching body. As the cracked clock on the wall kept ticking forward, so did the army of the Federation. Crawling closer and closer, driving a dagger through the atrocity that had taken over the rightful lands of the Rus. Tick, tick, tick.\n\nThe lackeys standing beside in loyalty had now dispersed to a place well-accustomed for the Brudershaft: Hell. Vagner rocked back and forth in his chair, staring at the rippled map sprawled across the table. The official map of the Aryan Brotherhood, encompassing all of West Russia. He smiled thinking back to those days in Perm. How joyous he was at the news of his conquests. As the war against the "Sub-Humans" gradually moved west, Vagner found himself more and more glued to the map. Living his glorious victory over Judeo-Bolshevism inside the confines of his own mind.\n\nThree knocks sounded throughout the shelter, and for once in several hours, Vagner looked up from his perfect world. Several voices could be heard outside, each speaking in crude "savage tongue". Holding tightly onto the grip of his Walther P38, Vagner took one final glance at his life's work, and smiled."

Kozin grunted, and slid a few bills into Amet-khan's palm.\n\nThe General nodded towards the smoke-blanketed city. "Shouldn't have bet against the bastards. They're honorable, if nothing else."\n\nThe last soldiers of the West Russian Revolutionary Front strode towards the Federation's position with impeccable precision. More than half were wounded; missing eyes, arms in slings, and rickety crutches did nothing to impede their proud march. And at the head, bearing the flag… could it be?\n\n"Marshal Zhukov," Amet-khan said. "Thank you for joining us. We were told to expect Nikolai Ryzhkov."\n\nZhukov thrust the flag into the wet earth with a grunt of exertion. "Nikolai Ivanovich is dead," he said. "A Federation bomber killed him and half the Arkhangelsk Soviet three days ago. I'm afraid you'll have to negotiate with me."\n\n"Very well. We have the agreement here, signed by President Shukshin and approved by the Federation Duma."\n\n"Will my men be safe?"\n\n"Yes. In fact, here, read it yourself." Amet-khan handed the Marshal a copy of the treaty. Zhukov unfolded it, and began to read. "Your men will be given medical treatment, and evacuated to Magadan. Whether they remain in the Far East as Federation citizens or leave for brighter shores is their choice."\n\n"Good, good." Zhukov smiled like a man who saw hell and came out the other side. "They deserve the world. I've never fought with such tough sons of bitches."\n\n"Well, maybe not the world," Amet-khan said. "The leadership of the Front will be scattered throughout Russia. But as long as you retire from the military, and pledge to exclude yourself from national politics, we'll leave you alone. You can enjoy the retirement you deserve."\n\nZhukov looked back to the last survivors of Arkhangelsk. Rows of upon rows of soldiers stood upright, eyes straight forward, pupils glittering beneath the sun. "You know, if Akhromeyev was here, he'd tell me to fight to my last breath," Zhukov said. "But we've lost. The Front is dead. I won't let my men die with it." The Marshal extended his hand to Amet-khan. "Sir, we accept your terms.""

 unification_war.3.desc:0 "Staring from the Winter Kremlin down on to the streets below, the Grand Marshal was lost in thought. How could the Red Army, the strongest of all, from the taiga to the British seas, lose to the forces of capitalism? He did everything right. He instilled discipline. He used superior strategy and theory. He militarized the state. His head spinning, he could barely hear Marshal Ustinov's pleas to flee.\n\n"Grand Marshal! We must go! We don't have much time, there are tunnels that lead us down to the docks. If we leave now we can-" Glass shattered as a bullet ripped through Ustinov's throat. Laying on the ground and choking on his own blood, he reached his bloodied hand out to the Grand Marshal. Tukhachevsky knelt down and gave his dying protege his ushanka. "Rest easy, friend." he said, a single tear streaming down his face.\n\nThe Grand Marshal hurried down the stairs and down into the basement of the Winter Kremlin. He was greeted by the three most influential members of the Presidium, Nikolai Podgorny, Grigory Romanov, and Viktor Chernomyrdin. The group unlocked the armory next to the entrance to the tunnels, each taking weapons to defend themselves from the capitalist pigs that would be waiting for them. As they walked down the dim corridor, the sounds of gunfire echoed above them. At the end of the tunnel, Chernomhyrdin lifted the hatch, as the four men climbed out onto the ruined street. A submarine was waiting for them in port, a mere hundred meters away. As the men began to sprint, they came under heavy fire from Shukshin's forces. Bullets whizzed as they began to fall, one by one. First, Chernomyrdin. Then, Romanov. Finally, Podgorny offered to hold off the enemy while the Grand Marshal made it to the submarine. The two exchanged a quick glance, a sign of mutual respect.\n\nPodgorny crouched behind a rock, returning fire as the Grand Marshal successfully made it into the submarine. He opened the hatch and climbed in. Greeted by the captain of the craft, Tukhchevsky ordered that they leave now and not wait for any other essential personnel. The submarine shook as he heard mines go off in the harbor, the rations next to the pilot's head falling down onto him. They quickly pulled away from the harbor, as Tukhachevsky realized that this would likely be the last time he would be able to see his beloved Russia."

"Paramount Leader, we've done the best we can, but the equipment you gave us- "\n\nZhdanov cut him off. "Are the best examples of Ultravisionary scientific achievement to date, unlike your quaint tactics. You are relieved of command. Comrade Chelomei, we must activate Project: Visionary." Zhdanov stalked out of the bunker's war room, Chelomei following at his heel. Karbyshev, the silent witness to Oplesnin's humiliation, offered him a glance of sympathy before running after his master.\n\nKarbyshev panted as he caught up to the marching pair. "Comrades, I'm not aware of Project: Visionary," he said.\n\n"That was intentional," Chelomei said. "Visionary was designed by Special Circumstances, not the People's Commissariat of Science. It's a failsafe, designed to preserve our revolutionary superculture in the event of the Federation's destruction."\n\nThey rounded a corner, sprinting down the neon-lit tunnels. A distant explosion shook their bones. "The Collective Consciousness Initiative failed," Zhdanov said, "but like all great experiments, it paved the way for the true discovery. Human consciousness is essentially electrical, no? We've found a way to transfer the energy of human brainwaves into any electronic system- for instance, a computer."\n\nThe group found their way to Zhdanov's private lab. A padded chair lay in the center of the room. Above it, a series of electrodes dangled from the ceiling. "From there, the consciousness can infiltrate any electronic system. In effect, achieving immortality." Zhdanov threw himself into the chair; together, he and Chelomei applied the electrodes to his skull.\n\n"Has this been tested?" Karbyshev said.\n\n"No, but the science is sound," Zhdanov said. "Chelomei, activate the system!"\n\nChelomei flipped the breaker switch. An explosive bang stabbed Karbyshev's eardrums, and a blaze of light left him reeling and blind. Yet, as his vision began to return, the smell of burnt meat filled his nostrils."

"Christ, the fucking building is going to collapse!"\n\nSvetlana forced herself to her feet, clutching her aching side. That stabbing pain was a broken rib, if not several. But none of that would matter if she suffocated. The Premier covered her mouth and nose with a scrap of her torn cardigan. She could barely see; the acrid smoke stung her eyes like a rabid wasp, like dozens of needles jabbing into her corneas over and over again. Bukharina forced herself to shuffle forward, feeling her way across the cluttered floor. Her ankle was sprained, and every step sent shooting pains up her leg and into her chest.\n\nThe building groaned. At this rate, she wasn't going to make it. Svetlana couldn't remember the layout of the building, but the entrance could only be a few feet away. Every step was agony, and she could barely move for the burning debris that littered the ground. There was no time. She forced herself to walk faster.\n\nHer dress caught on a fallen beam, and she fell. Svetlana's head smacked into the wooden floor as hard as a meteor crashing to Earth; her vision went dark, and her inner ear vomited into her skull. A weak gasp exited her throat.  Wait, what was happening? Why was she so hot?\n\n"Comrade Bukharina!" someone shouted. "Comrade, where are you?"\n\nSvetlana couldn't hold her head up anymore. Blood trickled from a wound at the edge of her mouth into her chin. She tried to pull herself forward by her fingertips, but she wasn't strong enough. Bukharin's daughter passed into unconsciousness, ready to die."

 unification_war.6.t:0 "Cloak of the Red Eminence"
 unification_war.6.desc:0 "The wretched yelp of gunfire sounded across Syktyvkar. Every neighborhood of the beleaguered city seemed to have sprouted a rag-tag militia. Fanatic commissars marched door-to-door, whipping the proletariat into a frenzied defense of Marxism's last bastion. Even the schoolchildren had expropriated their father's rifles.\n\nIn the heart of the city, Corporal Joseph Stepanchikov pounded his fist into a cracked podium. "Bastards must have known we were coming," he said. "We should have nabbed half of the city's officials by now."\n\nPrivate Dragunov laid out a map of Syktyvkar; important locations were circled in a blistering red marker. "There are two likely locations for the remaining USSR leadership," he said. "The headquarters of the Communist Party of Komi, and this printing shop."\n\n"A printing shop?"\n\n"Yes sir," Dragunov said. "We have intelligence that indicates the building was formerly associated with the Passionary. It's been fortified ten times over with weaponry and, to our knowledge, an underground bunker. Possibly a way to escape the city in the event of an invasion."\n\n"Very well. Let's split up. Alpha squad, take Gamma and Tau and converge on the KPK headquarters. Beta, Kappa, you're with me. We're going to hit the books," Stepanchikov said.\n\nThe commandos charged across the city, dodging bullets and burning debris with deadly grace. Within an hour, Stepanchikov had seized the print shop, and its underground bunker, and arrested the surviving Communists within. Alpha squad in turn had battered down the gates of the KPK headquarters, where they found a trembling Boris Ponomaryov burning crucial documents. Suslov was nowhere in sight.\n\nIn the Eastern district of the city, in a neighborhood already burned and looted by the Federation's army, an older man hid his face beneath a simple peasant's cap. He thanked the proprietors of his favorite luncheon spot- a simple tea business, once known for its ties to Svetlana Bukharina- with a generous tip, and stepped into the night. His nondescript clothing was adorned only by patches and sewn up holes. His oval glasses reflected carnage, fire, and death. The Red Eminence permitted himself a sigh, and began his journey to Orenburg.\n\nFrom there, he could go anywhere he pleased."

He lay there, trembling, for a heartbeat. "Jesus Christ, the Federation is going to kill us all," he said.\n\nPopov had awoken at 04:00 to jets roaring over his apartment. That was hardly unusual. It wasn't as though the Republic lacked an air force, although they tended to practice their maneuvers around 14:00. But then the adjoining apartment building detonated, blown to bits by a Federation bomb. Popov had done what he could, fighting to save his neighbors from the resulting fire while still in his pajamas. But nothing he'd done could bring back the twenty-four people killed in the explosion.\n\nThe Federation Air Force had won the battle for aerial supremacy. They rendered the Syktyvkar Air Field useless within minutes of commencing their attack. Now they swooped about, bombing the city seemingly without regard to strategy or purpose. The terror Popov had seen while restoring order, the horror he'd born witness to, made the WRRF invasion seem like playacting. The whole city was on fire. Were they simply trying to murder the entire population?\n\nThen it hit him. "Oh God," he moaned, "the arsenal."\n\nThe Federation must have found out about the Syktyvkar Arsenal. They must be trying to collapse the entrance, or otherwise destroy the facility before the ground invasion began. But they were bombing the wrong half of the city!\n\nOfficer Popov glanced towards the sky. A fresh flight of Federation bombers were already approaching. In the distance, what was left of the Republican Guard prepared a set of useless and battered AA guns. Half had already been blown to bits; their brothers would join them soon.\n\n"Fuck this," Popov muttered. "I'm not dying for a lost cause." He holstered his service weapon and began to run. He wouldn't escape the next bombardment, but with a bit of luck he'd make it out of the city alive."

Svetlana had served as her own defense counsel. Unlike the show-trials her father's loyalists had suffered, the jury had at least listened to her arguments, not that it made a difference. Her sentence was a decade in prison, with three years off for good behavior. She chuckled, despite it all; the war had been so pointless in the end. So many had died, and for what?\n\nA gentle knock resounded at the door. "Come in," she said.\n\nHer visitor was a man in a crisp black suit and a grey tie. He wore no adornments, save for a silver watch. His hair was unwashed. Dark rings hung from his eyes, the scars of many sleepless nights. He stepped into the room, a set of papers in hand, and looked her straight in the eye.\n\n"Svetlana Stalina," President Shukshin said, "you have caused me so much trouble."\n\n"Mister President, I must apologize, but as you can see I am already repenting for my sins."\n\nA near imperceptible sneer rose up on Shukshin's mouth. "You and I have so many reasons to hate each other," he said. Shukshin handed her the pile of papers. "I think we can agree to never be on friendly terms."\n\nStalina raised an eyebrow. She glanced at the papers, still warm from the printer. The packet was labeled ‘Federal Anti-Corruption Bureau'. "You want to give me a job?" Stalina said. "Why, the gall-"\n\nShukshin cut her off. "Sign the paper. You'll legally be imprisoned for a decade, no matter what. But rotting in a prison cell isn't justice. This way, you can make a difference, start to rebuild the damage from the war." He smiled. "And I think we can agree, it'll be much less boring."\n\nSvetlana looked Shukshin straight in the eye. "You're a bastard. But I'll sign. Can I start Monday, or do I need to beg you for that too?""

 unification_war.9.desc:0 "The battle for Syktyvkar raged from day to night, night to day, unceasing, like the roar of a great river. The exhausted Ordosocialisty had nothing left except their zeal and a few spent rifles. The remaining officer corps fought the Federation armed forces block-to-block, sacrificing their own lives in a doomed attempt to stop columns of armored behemoths. Mortars and rockets crashed around the city, cutting lives short and smashing the city to dust. Slowly, ever so slowly, the Federation's army approached the Ordosocialist Party Headquarters.\n\nIvan Serov, the New Marx, Guiding Star of the National Soviet Republic, sat in his dimly lit bunker overlooking a mess of sprawled-out maps. They tracked the Federation's advance into the city, updated hourly by messenger. Outside, under-strength infantry regiments desperately tried to hold the line, closing a ring of steel around their Vozdh and his remaining bodyguards.\n\nOne of Serov's lesser servants, Antonia, broke the silence in his bunker. "S-sir," she said, "we should go. There's an escape tunnel just underneath here. If we all take it, we can bypass the encirclement. We can smuggle you out through Arkhangelsk, find you someplace safe."\n\n"Silence. Russia is my home. It is my soul. I will overcome these liberal degenerates, or I will die in this city".\n\n"But sir-"\n\n"Ivanov?" Serov said, indicating the closest of his bodyguards. "Take Antonia outside and shoot her."\n\nShe screamed as Ivanov dragged her out of the bunker by the hair. A single gunshot ended her pitiful cries, like a child stamping on the head of a wounded bird.\n\nBut the thud of artillery fire grew closer. It inched forward, crawling its way through the line of defenders and unto the very threshold of Serov's bunker. Men were blown to bits, and boys turned to flee from the inevitable. Ivan Alexandrovich Serov, the man who outfoxed Suslov, knew how he'd be remembered.\n\nHe balled up the map and threw it to the floor, crushing it under his jet-black heel. "Comrades, do you all have weapons?"\n\nOf the fifteen people in the bunker, perhaps half had a pistol. The others clutched clubs, or chair legs hastily torn from their mounts. But none of them could imagine a future without Serov."

There was no chance. He'd never make it to Finland now, especially not on foot. Shafarevich was stranded on the road to Ukhta, his bodyguards dead, with no weapon or even much money. It was freezing outside. Igor's breath curled into billows of steam as it left his chapped lips, and his toes were nearly numb. The boom of artillery was close enough to shake his rib cage. God forbid one of those shells landed on the truck.\n\nShafarevich had to go back. He was surrounded- but he could imagine saving himself by signing a peace treaty, or ordering what remained of his soldiers to stand down. That fucking small nation hypocrite Shukshin would doom Russia, but at the very least Igor could lurch out of danger. Yes, that was it; he'd surrender to the commander of the nearest battalion, and they'd take him to the President of their useless Federation.\n\nIgor trudged through the bullets and around the pitched battles that surrounded him, wincing whenever a gunshot resounded. He fought through the pain of walking on numb feet. Finally, he found two soldiers who looked calm enough not to shoot on sight.\n\nHe limped over to them, hands in the air. He straightened his back, and did his best to overawe them. "You two! I surrender," he said. "Now bring me to your commander. The President of the Russian Free Republic will call for peace."\n\nThe two soldiers looked at each other, silent for a long moment. One shined his flashlight in Igor's face. He snarled. "Damn, it is him."\n\n"Motherfucker," the other hissed. "So this is who Vasily died for." The soldiers glanced at each other. Their faces went cold, and one nodded to the other.\n\nAn artillery shell exploded dozens of meters away, lighting up the entire clearing. Shafarevich saw the eagle on black emblazoned on the uniforms of the soldiers before him. His heart went cold. The soldiers of the Russian Free Republic hoisted their weapons, cleared their sights, and took aim at his heart."

Men and women, yes, but mostly children. They had been flayed alive, or garroted, or run through with bayonets. Many had been strangled. Piles of corpses were shoved up against the walls, tangled together in a miserable, disrespectful heap. Limbs flopped in the putrid wind.\n\nStepanchikov's squad of commandos advanced down the street. The scent of rotting meat assailed them from every angle. Crows flew from rafters to peck and tear at more recent victims. Joseph began to whisper to himself. "Don't look. Don't look. Don't look-"\n\n"Sir, your orders?" Private Dragunov said.\n\nStephanchikov swallowed a mouthful of vomit. "Stay sharp. I think… I think they're finished in this area."\n\nThe soldiers stepped down the street, rifles ready, scanning the bloodied corners with detached professionalism. There was no sound save the whistling wind. The air tasted of copper, and bile. Every one of the servicemen had been at war for decades; they'd seen visions out of hell, things no human being should be forced to see. This was the worst place they'd ever experienced.\n\nAfter what seemed like days, the squadron made their way to the marble and gold gates of Taboritsky's Palace. Outside, three women were crucified; signs hung from their necks, marking them as a Jew, an adultress, or a witch. Each had been mutilated with knives. The commandos inched inside the Palace, guns drawn, prepared to defend themselves. Dozens of Sturmoviki lay dead at the gates to Taboritsky's dwelling. Dragunov turned one over with his foot. "Sir, it's Larionov. He's been shot in the back of the head."\n\nA distant, incomprehensible shout echoed from the Regent's residence. The commandos ran inside, past the innumerable dead, and into Taboritsky's throne room. The Blessed Regent stood, a young child in his grasp. He was four, maybe five, with dark hair and a pallid complexion. His head lolled side to side; Taboritsky's grip had broken his neck.\n\nThe Regent shouted, a manic, infernal sound that froze Stephanchikov's soul with dread. Tears of joy ran down the old man's face. "I found him! I found Alexei!"\n\nA hail of gunfire ended his Regency a heartbeat later."

Having gathered everything he could fit on his trusty steed, the former leader had fled day and night through what remained of Eurasia until he could disappear where no army would follow him: Kazakhstan.\n\nFrom the halls of knives and daggers in Syktyvkar to the leader of a united West Russia, Gumilyov was pained to see his idea fall so short of fruition. No more would the riders of old reclaim the glory of Genghis and crush the Atlanticist menace or the Pan-Asian pretenders. No more would the Great Ethos be realized into a promised land for all Asiatic People's free from the tyranny of Imperialism or Cultural Colonialism.\n\nIn just a couple weeks time, the Eurasian Ideal would be wiped to dust in the name of the decadent "Federation". Only now Gumilyov wouldn't give them the satisfaction of a mugshot or a bullet in the head.\n\nHe turned his head to face the sun rising over his homeland for what would be his final time, and whisked himself into the great emptiness.

He glanced across the pinewood table. An owlish creature sat alone at the other end, cleaning his glasses. Perhaps his guest naturally chose the setting most congenial to his cold soul.\n\nMiletiy Zykov, chief of the Vlasovites, coughed gently into a handkerchief. This was the traitor, the usurper, so absorbed in his greed and pride that he tried to rip Russia in two. Shukshin's experts warned him the snake would try to overawe him with his silver tongue and limitless energy. But Zykov only stared blank-faced into the ink-whipped papers before him. Suddenly, he looked up at Shukshin."Last night, I told my people to fill me in on what was happening on your side of the line."\n\n"What'd they say?"\n\nZykov pursed his lips before he spoke again. "I already got all the details. They made me an aide-mémoire, the better to organize my thoughts." A smirk crept across Zykov's face. "Says your government was run by epaulet-wearing lunkheads, until you gave the power back to the people."\n\nShukshin nodded slowly, just barely stifling a scowl.\n\nZykov flashed a knowing grin and went on. "Good work. And I'm hearing the sons of the soil eat like kings and plow their fields with up-to-the-minute gear." Zykov's gaze shifted back to the paperwork. Reaching into his worn coat for a pen, he extended his arm across the table, past his notes, and scratched his name at the bottom of the Russian Republic's instrument of surrender with a shaking hand.\n\n"I hope you realize what's happening," declared Zykov. "The man who surrenders once isn't apt to do it again, at least when his dignity is a dear thing."\n\nShukshin cocked his head and studied him closely, nonplussed. "What do you mean?"\n\nZykov returned his gaze and smiled wistfully. "It means," he said, "I've won.""

With an amateurish, unpracticed motion, Mila drew her rusted revolver. She fired it three times into Bunyachenko's back, piercing his lungs despite her shaking hands.

The fanatic Hyperboreans refused to cede even an inch of holy ground to the profligate invaders. Like their ancestors, they fought the inevitable with a majestic and suicidal strength. Soon, every one of them would walk hand-in-hand with Veles unto verdant Iriy.\n\n"Clear!" Six Russian soldiers entered the former mayor's building. The structure had transformed into the high priest's temple over years of agonizing mutation. The walls were scrawled with crudely carved runes and soaring depictions of past triumphs. Three teenagers charged, wielding woodcutter's axes and knives; their lives ended with three precise shots.\n\nThe squad moved into the building with ice cold efficiency, checking corners, watching constantly for booby-traps or ambushes. They penetrated the temple, defiling the blessed corridors, and within minutes reached the threshold of Velimir's throne room. Inside, the pagan king was beating a messenger to death with his gore-soaked hammer, flinging the child's brains across the room like a painter tossing color at a canvas. The squad absorbed this scene of total depravity with iron stomachs, counted to three, and charged.\n\nThe squad surrounded Velimir in a semicircle. Every rifle pointed at the barbarian's heart.  "You have until the count of three to surrender," Sergeant Smirnoff said.\n\nVelimir raised a closed fist, a hateful glare marring his face. "None of you pests realize what you've done. You've slaughtered the Aryan Race! Your souls will be punished for eternity!"\n\nHe opened his fist to reveal a detonator."If I am destined to fall, then it shall be by my father's hand."\n\nSergeant Smirnoff depressed his rifle's trigger. Velimir depressed his detonator's switch. Three bullets took flight, caressed the air, and stabbed into Velimir's chest.

Most of the city was taken, miles behind enemy lines and no hope for salvation. Inside the city, the last vestiges of the battered garrison guarded the final entrypoint to the bunkers below that were not covered by rubble or sealed off from the inside.\n\nNikita Khrushchev was jolted awake by the thunder of artillery. Groggy, he pulled the covers back over his head. The bunker shook. Resigned to having to wake up early today, he put on his slippers and got out of bed. He went to the bunker's kitchen, where his wife was waiting for him with a notebook. Khruschev's Rule, or so he and his subordinates called it, was to keep all the happenings of the night before in a journal and have it read back to them in the morning.\n\n"After consulting with the remaining generals, you were told that defense of Tyumen would be impossible with the current number of troops the Union has," Nina began. "They suggested you leave the city through the underground bunkers or disguised as a refugee."\n\n"They're full of horseshit if they ever think I'd risk death in such an undignified way," Nikita replied, pouring cornmeal into a bowl and beginning to stir. The old stove let out a burst of steam.\n\n"You got so upset that you began throwing bread at the generals," she continued.\n\n"What? I don't remember doing that!" Nikita replied.\n\n"This is your handwriting, not mine," Nina responded.\n\nOver the course of breakfast, the sound of artillery kept growing louder. With every passing minute, more artillery fire was concentrated on the bunker. Dust shot out from the cracks in the walls. Children cried from down the hallway as their parents held on to them tightly. Pots and pans began falling off the shelf. Nikita extended hand towards Nina, taking her hand and guiding her out of her chair. The pair embraced as the ceiling began to cave in.

And Ivan, Ekaterina, Lev, Alexei... everyone who'd stayed to fight with him. For him, and for Russia.\n\nBatov ejected a spent cartridge from his rifle and reloaded. In the few seconds of silence, he felt a sense of peace. In the name of Russia, he had done everything he could. His brave men had given it their all, and he was proud of every one of them. Perhaps Pavel Batov would go down in history as yet another tyrant, no better than the madmen of Omsk or the traitors of Samara. If anything, he had proven to himself that he was no Yazov, no Averin, and definitely not a Vlasov. He was not a tyrant, but a true patriot of his motherland.\n\nHell, maybe he and Shukshin weren't so different after all. They say war is a tragedy, but what is more tragic than a war between brothers? Despite all their differences, were they not the true soldiers of Russia? Servants, freed from the greed, brutality, and idealism so many had succumbed to? Maybe so, but none of that mattered now.\n\nAt the end of it all, Pavel was a soldier. He had a duty to fulfill, and he would fulfill it until the very end. He peeked around the corner. No chance. There were at least ten rifles trained on his position. But the one on the right seemed to be wavering- perhaps wounded?\n\n"Pavel Batov, come out with your hands up. You have ten seconds to comply!"\n\nHell, he'd seen worse odds.

"The projectile which shattered your clavicle missed the subclavian artery by only four millimeters."\n\nThe soldier grunted. "Suppose I'm lucky."\n\n"No such thing. Your opponent simply had poor aim."\n\n"Just a training accident." The Black Leaguer slid off the operating table and limped into the waiting room. The individual's antalgic gait likely indicated the presentation of inflammation in the ankle, perhaps a sprain.

Dropouts who wanted a quick stitch-up before they went to get revenge. And himself, whenever he told his wife he was working late. And yes, Vlasin considered himself something of a people reader. But no one except the most gullible knave could believe that the dozens of soldiers treated today were wounded in a training accident.\n\nThe doctor adjusted his lab coat and crept down the dark corridor that led to the waiting room.

Most wore thick scarves and woolen mittens. A few simply pulled jacket collars around their exposed necks. But the railroad did not turn away from the cold; he stood, firm and undefeatable, absorbing the icy blows like a mountain.\n\nTo the railroad's East lay Novosibirsk, neon signs and sun-like lamp posts visible even miles from the city. Skyscrapers stood in her heart, grasping towards the unreachable sky. Thousands of cars scurried about the city. She was the metropolis that reunited a nation, the land of strength, the core of the Federation's economy and government. To the railroad's West lay Syktyvkar and her Republic. Hers was a war torn land, territory still pock-marked with Communist guerillas and savage Hitlerite tribesmen. But hers too was a land of strength. The liberals had faced invasion after invasion, not to mention the brutal urban insurrection she'd put down in her infancy. Any polity that had overcome the Urals was a government worth befriending.\n\nAnd befriend her they would. "President Shukshin, the hammer is ready," one of the workers said. At the gentleman's feet, the last railroad spike was ready to be driven into half-frozen Earth. This moment was the culmination of a year of work. This railroad would fly through Omsk, Tyumen, and the Urals, connecting the Federation to their friends to the West. With a single stroke, Shukshin would unite the two halves of Free Russia.\n\nShukshin picked up the sledgehammer. It was heavy, unwieldy, not the sort of tool he was used to working with. "What's your name?" he asked the engineer.\n\n"Maksim, sir."\n\n"Where are you from, Maksim?"\n\n"Gorky, sir. Parents still live there."\n\n"Ah, I see." Shukshin weighed the sledge in his hands.

Rows upon rows of infantrymen stood before the stage, uniforms neatly pressed and blemishless. Dozens of tank commanders stood atop their mounts, armor shining in the blazing sunlight. The wind whistled through their fresh cut hair.  A cohort of Union air force officers stood at attention amidst the crowd; most of their compatriots were absent, having opened the ceremony with a series of explosive, life threatening sorties. To Shukshin's eyes, it seemed a miracle that no one had crashed.\n\nOr maybe they were just that good.\n\nThe entire stadium of soldiers saluted simultaneously. Their freshly shined boots crashed into the ground, nearly smashing Shukshin's eardrums with their precision.

Russia had experienced something unseen since the Thirty Years War; she had utterly, and completely, collapsed. The Tsar, the Soviets, and the Germans had all failed. There were no true successors, though many claimed otherwise. But there were still idealists, still leaders, people who would stand up for their nation and rebuild the ruins.

He could only engage in damage control for his collapsing republic. Zykov entered his quiet office. "Troitsky, how many of our party members defected to the RAPP in that referendum?"\n\n"Well, the statistics are simply too long for me to summarize thoroughly, but it's not looking good sir," Troitsky slid the reports.

This country was his home. He had hoped that one day, he might be able to bring peace to all of Russia and ensure that everyone had the opportunity to achieve a comfortable living. Now, it was clear that he would die a forgotten warlord, only a footnote in history. But as he had promised his wife, he would see it to the end.\n\nThe doors to his office burst open, and one of his generals came in. "Sir, we can't hold the city any longer. They've breached the outer ring of our defenses and are pressing against the inner one. I don't know how long it will hold, but it won't hold long. Perhaps we could consider-"\n\nThe general was interrupted by Petlin, who turned to the aged Russian with the faintest of frowns. "Signal to the enemy our surrender. Let the men lay down their arms. I don't want any more bloodshed for a hopeless cause. These men deserve a life, and a life I shall give them." Once the general nodded in acknowledgment of the orders, Petlin added, "I would like an escort to discuss our unconditional surrender with their lead general. Please arrange that as quickly as can be managed."\n\nWhen the general left once more, Petlin stared back out at the city. He hoped that they would not execute him, and that he might see his family once more. With the image of his wife in his mind, he let himself smile."

"I am fucking Mikhail Matkovsky and you will let me through!" He yelled, the veins on his neck popping as his face turned red with fury. Nobody moved for him. Did these fucking peasants not know who he was? "I must get on that boat!" He cried, a touch of desperation now entering his voice as he was met with a wall of people, all shuffling only centimeters at a time towards the ships.\n\nThen, one of the ships blew its horn, and began to slip out of the dock. Fuck. He didn't have a lot of time, he'd have to get to the second one. Just as he turned to shove his way to the second one, it too blew its horn and began to depart. All along the docks, the ships had reached well beyond their full capacity. Their captains had signaled that it was time to go, and they were leaving the rest to their fate. Leaving Matkovsky.\n\n"No! No! Someone get me a radio! I must speak with one of the captains, they must get back to the docks!" The surrounding refugees paid him no mind, perhaps supposing that it was the ramblings of some madman. They were all turning back to look for another way to flee the city, but Matkovsky was committed to reaching the docks. Perhaps if he–\n\nHe was not able to finish the thought as he slipped and fell onto the hard concrete ground, the throngs of refugees stepping over him as they all rushed to get away from the docks. Then the first boot stomped on his arm, followed by another that slammed its way into his groin. His body convulsed as pain shot through him but another foot slammed into his head, cracking it hard against the concrete. Boot after boot followed, and when the dock had cleared, the body of Mihkail Matkovsky remained."

Knowing full well that no one would dare to live out in the dense taiga, they were on high alert. Their watchful eyes darted from one treeline to the next, praying that whoever is out here doesn't get the first shot off on them, but the only resistance they found on their trek was the cold wind in their faces.\n\nAs the patrol came ever closer to the source of the smoke, the sight they saw was somewhat unexpected. There were no signs of life anywhere near the fire, save for themselves. The officer on hand gave his orders to spread out and advance up to the treeline just before the fire to get into cover. With their weapons raised, the men briskly moved towards their objective, setting up lines of fire all around the source of light. Yet, again, they found no resistance.\n\nWhen the men finally reached the source of the light, they found that it was but a smoldering wreck of a helicopter. It didn't resemble anything Russian-built, that much was certain. The patrol started its way towards the wreck, until a voice shouted, "Body! Over there!"\n\nJust before the helicopter layed a camouflage clad man, a box of cigars next to him, and what appeared to be a blood-covered submachine gun still in his hands. The officer moved up to inspect the body, and ordered two men to flip over the deceased man. As they did, revealing his face, the sight they saw was unmistakable. In spite of the snow covering his face and the frostbite eating away at his extremities, they had found their objective.\n\nSpeaking into a handheld radio, the officer reported back to high command.\n\n"Sir, this is Fox 3. We've located Mitchell Werbell. He's dead. Looks like shrapnel wounds bled him out. Over." Handing the radio back over, the officer looked down at the body before him. He stared towards the man who had taken over his homeland and ruled for nothing but his own fortune. Yet, he was a man of honor.

There were countries that might still take them in, the last of the political leadership of the old Soviet Union. At last, Bessonov shook his head and stood.\n\n"We are the Presidium of the Soviet Union," He began.

No. We are the All-Union Communist Party, and we shall remain in Russia."\n\nA silence fell on the room. None had known which way Bessonov might fall. He may have been idealistic, but he was also a practical man.

He would not flee, not now. He had pledged himself to serve Communism no matter what, and if that meant his death, so be it.\n\n"The enemy soldiers are moving in on all fronts," One of the officers said, breaking the spell on the room.

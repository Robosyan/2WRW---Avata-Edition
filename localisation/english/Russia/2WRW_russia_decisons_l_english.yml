 vyborg_border_conflict.1.desc:0 "The city of Vyborg was won by the Soviet Union back in 1940 when Red Army troops triumphed over the Finnish troops.

 RUS_europeansupport.1.desc:0 "As the war between the [GER.GetName] and the [FROM.GetName] rages in Eastern Europe, we have remained as spectators to the fighting.\n\nUntil now.\n\n[ROOT.GetAdjective] diplomats have approached our government, requesting weapons and aid in their effort against the Reich. Whilst many in our government sympathise with the Slavs of Eastern Europe who have long endured under the German boot, there are those who fear the consequnces we would face should the Reich triumph over the Russians once more."

The Russians have made a case to our government, citing the constant meddling in the Italian sphere of influence by the Reich and its puppets.\n\nWhile the Russians indeed make a strong case, the question for Italy now is whether we should risk supporting Russia in their war against Germany or leave the Northern Europeans to their war effort and maintain the Mediterranian status quo."

 RUS_europeansupport.5.desc:0 "After much debate and discussion by high ranking officals within the Italian government, the Italian Empire has eagerly decided to support the Russian Federation in its effort against the German Reich.\n\nKeen on seeing the Reich suffer the consequnces of its meddling in Mediterranian affars, Italy has provided us with financial resources and investments to help support the Russian Federation's economy and assure Russian victory against the Wehrmacht is achieved with the door for future economic and diplomatic oppertunities in the future."

"

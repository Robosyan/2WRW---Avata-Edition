 RUS_WRW_Generic_Communist_tree: "Communist War Tree"
 RUS_One_Once_More_tt: "We are one nation again!"
 RUS_One_Once_More: "United And Invincible"
 RUS_One_Once_More_desc: "[RUSGetUniqueNamePlain]. For the first time in decades, after a struggle unheard of in Russian history we are one state again. Never will there be another fall from grace as long as we march under [ROOT.GetLeader]'s banner - yet challenges still remain if socialism is to be instilled in the world forevermore.\n\nTo the south, Kazakhstan and the Steppes of Central Asia lie in chaos, waiting for the liberation of a new Union. To the east, the vile Empire of Japan has seized our eastern pearl, reclaiming Vladivostok will be a tall order indeed. And of course, to the west lies our greatest failure.\n\n§xWe will not fall a third time§!."
 RUS_The_Peoples_Army_Marches_West: "The People's Army Marches West"
 RUS_The_Peoples_Army_Marches_West_tt: "The reclamation of [RUSGetUniqueNamePlain]'s §xstolen territory§! from the §oGerman Reich§! will commence"
 RUS_The_Peoples_Army_Marches_West_desc: "Some of our comrades say that the dream of a Communist state has been achieved. They may even say that it’s unnecessary to reclaim Eastern Europe.\n\nComrade [ROOT.GetLeader] disagrees.\n\nAlthough yes, [RUSGetUniqueNamePlain] has been “unified” under the banner of the workers, millions of our countrymen are yet to be freed from their fascist overlords. While some of our more revanchist populace have argued for total retribution against the Reich, a fate they would perhaps deserve, we cannot risk engulfing the world in nuclear hellfire. Instead, the Commissars of the Red Army have proposed a comprehensive battleplan to restore our hold over the eastern Reichskommisarriats. [ROOT.GetLeader] has approved of these plans, and we have already begun the mobilization process.\n\nSoon, the liberation of millions of workers will commence. The ultimate test of [ROOT.GetNameDef] has come."
 RUS_Mobilize_the_Proletariat: "Mobilize the Proletariat"
 RUS_Mobilize_the_Proletariat_desc: "“Workers of the revolution! Your Motherland calls for your aid, you must serve your country! Your work is required to liberate the Motherland from the fascist tumor in Eastern Europe! Enlist today!”\n\nAll around our cities, this message will be plastered on houses, markets, factories, and whatever other wall we can find. The only way we can defeat the Germanic horde is if every man and woman are either on the frontlines or in the factories. Soon, the workers of Eastern Europe will be liberated!"
 RUS_A_Gun_in_Every_Hand: "A Gun in Every Hand"
 RUS_A_Gun_in_Every_Hand_desc: "A soldier’s core weapon is his gun. However, guns in the Siberian wasteland can be hard to come by nowadays. We will have to rely on Bukharin-era weapon caches to keep our mighty Red Army afloat. Though, this process should be easy.\n\nDue to the recent findings of old Soviet documents in Kazan, A search party of elite Siberian soldiers was able to locate at least a dozen weapon stashes. Shockingly enough, thousands of weapons, grenades, & ammo boxes were found within these abandoned buildings. Although we are unsure of the quality of the weapons, we need every last gun for the liberation of the Motherland."
 RUS_A_Tide_of_Iron_and_Steel: "A Tide of Iron and Steel"
 RUS_A_Tide_of_Iron_and_Steel_desc: "Although infantry is the central piece to the game of war, it will take more than that to defeat the Fascist menace.\n\nIf we are to fight a modern war against a modern foe, we must have planes, tanks, APCs, a navy, and any and all other modern tools to defeat the Germans. We must be able to rapidly produce all this all throughout the war. With the power of the people’s spirit, we will be able to flood the Nazi’s defenses and cripple Germania within months!"
 RUS_The_Wehrmacht_Defunct: "The Wehrmacht, Defunct"
 RUS_The_Wehrmacht_Defunct_desc: "Within a few short months, we have been able to liberate untold thousands from the oppression of the Jackboot. But as we march ever forward, something strange has begun to happen. German soldiers are captured with increasingly less equipment. Guns from as far back as Barbarossa have become common in the hands of the Wehrmacht. Some battalions have even fully surrendered to us, each of which in truly terrible condition, from raging infections to malnourishment and dehydration.\n\nIt's become abundantly clear that the Heer has fallen from grace. It lies decrepit and on its last limb, no doubt in part from partisans putting in the work to sabotage the German’s supply lines. We can only hope that with the Wehrmacht in shambles we will be able to force a German capitulation soon."
 RUS_Moscow_Red_Once_More: "Moscow, Red\nOnce More"
 RUS_Moscow_Red_Once_More_desc: "Comrades, rejoice! Finally, the city of Moscow has been rid of German occupation, and the worker’s flag flies over the Kremlin once more. Although SS hideouts within the city still pester our garrisons, they will surely be routed in time, and any counter-attack the Nazi regime could throw at us will easily be repelled.\n\nComrade [ROOT.GetLeader] is scheduled to host a speech outside of what remains of the Kremlin. Soon, we will be able to undo the failures of Barbarossa, and free the rest of the Motherland from German tyranny!"
 RUS_Barbarossa_Redeemed: "Barbarossa Redeemed"
 RUS_Barbarossa_Redeemed_desc: "We have done it.\n\nThe failure and shame of Barbarossa is now but a fading memory. The thirty years of oppression, enslavement, and bloodshed under the fascist Reich has been banished to the pages of history, never again to return. Though we have not marched into Berlin proper, with our victory the Germans will surely fall by their own hand soon enough.\n\nWhatever the case across our borders, our territorial integrity has been restored. The Red Banner flies over a liberated Europe once more. [ROOT.GetNameDef]'s return to the world stage has arrived, for the good of the peasantry and the people, and one thing is clear:\n\nWe're here to stay."

 RUS_Slava_tt: "We are one nation again!"
 RUS_Slava: "Russia Triumphant!"
 RUS_Slava_desc: "[RUSGetUniqueNamePlain]. For the first time in decades, after a struggle unheard of in Russian history we are one state again. Never will there be another fall from grace as long as we march under [ROOT.GetLeader]'s banner - yet the world perceives us still as a devastated state with nothing to offer on the world table. This must be rectified.\n\nThe nations of the Steppe lie weak, preactically begging for subjugation. In a twisted recreation of 1905, the filthy Japanese and Manchu have robbed us of one of the nation's great triumphs. And for all their talk of Ubermensch, the Teutons appear fragile after a decade of strife. The time to strike is now, and if we succeed [ROOT.GetLeader] will be revered forevermore.\n\n§xFor now is the time to reclaim our place in the sun§!."
 RUS_Toppling_The_Menace:0 "Toppling the Menace"
 RUS_Toppling_The_Menace_tt:0 "The reclamation of [RUSGetUniqueNamePlain]'s §xstolen territory§! from the §oGerman Reich§! will commence"
 RUS_Toppling_The_Menace_desc:0 "Although our nation has been cleansed of the decadence and lies of democracy, communism, and other misguided movements and ideologies which would taint the fabric of Russia, there exists another great enemy, the German Third Reich. This foreign oppressor has subjugated and exploited the Russian people for decades, slowly erasing our culture and murdering an untold number of men, women, and children in cold blood.\n\nThe Russian people must declare loudly, and in one voice.\n\nNo more. We must embark upon the most trying and crucial war Russia has yet seen, and crush the Jackboot under the strength of the Russian Eagle in a war of righteous national reclamation. By the will of our nation, the blood of its people, and the grace of God, the Thousand Year Reich will be left in ashes."
 RUS_Honor_in_Labor:0 "Honor in Labor"
 RUS_Honor_in_Labor_desc:0 "There is much praise that can be given to our soldiers, those who act with valor every waking moment in the trenches and across the fields. However, we must not forget the strength of Russia's working man. The importance of their fealty to the cause of our nation, enduring long and arduous hours in the factories, cannot be understated. The sweat of their brows has given us every bullet and every gun that make corpses of every German we slay.\n\nNot only must we honor the work of our nations laborers, but that labor must be used to its fullest extent, through long hours and increased quotas. The weak may not be able to withstand such demanding work, but the strength of those who remain will embody the true spirit of the Russian people, ready to carry out all any and all needs of their nation."
 RUS_Praise_The_Soldiery:0 "Praise the Soldiery"
 RUS_Praise_The_Soldiery_desc:0 "The nature of our war of reclamation against the Germans and the tactics of modern conflict has proved destructive to both sides on a scale once unimaginable. Battlefields are littered with German corpses, slain by our brave soldiers, but our own military has bled and suffered in equal scale.\n\nWe must not forget the efforts of the common Russian, our proud soldiers who fight relentlessly and with the grit that defines heroes to restore our nation's honor. We must venerate these young men as saviors of our nation, the most noble and true Russia can offer. In this, we can expect our army to be of the highest morale and most diligent in their duties the world over, helping us to secure victory against the Reich."
 RUS_A_Westward_Wall:0 "A Westward Wall"
 RUS_A_Westward_Wall_desc:0 "As the German beast continues to struggle against our might they have tried time and time again to stamp out the light in all of our hearts. We must stop this internal demon from crawling atop our defenses. If the battleground is Eastern Europe then so be it. We shall expunge the filth from every inch of Russian soil through every drop of blood that falls from the German menace."
 RUS_Extinguishing_The_Prussian_Spirit:0 "Extinguishing the Prussian Spirit"
 RUS_Extinguishing_The_Prussian_Spirit_desc:0 "Since their land was first unified, the cultural hearth of the Germans has always been Prussia, from the militant nature of their state to the lineage of the Kaisers of old. In a similar sense, the Russians can trace themselves to the cities of Moscow and Saint Petersburg. However, while Konigsberg remains a cultural center of the Reich, our homeland remains occupied and a shadow of its former self. We have been humiliated for decades as the Teutonic menace continues to sully our national heritage.\n\nWe must teach the Germans to know the same despair and sorrow they have wrought upon Russia. As we lift the Jackboot off the throat of our nation, we must bring it down against our occupier. There is no honor in granting the Germans mercy. Through our victory, their once proud warrior culture will be lost to the flames of the Russian phoenix."
 RUS_A_Resurgent_Eagle:0 "A Resurgent Eagle"
 RUS_A_Resurgent_Eagle_desc:0 "As one superpower falls, another shall rise. Although we may have been shattered by revolution, war, instability, and poverty, we have done more than anyone else in the world has assumed of us. We have utterly demoralized and destroyed the German hoards. Our planes have caused millions of German mothers to weep. The east is aflame with destruction caused by us, but it was worth it. It is better for one day of blood than one hundred years of oppression. We have supplanted Germany as a superpower, yet we must plant the flag on top of the corpse of this dead beast."
 RUS_A_Russian_Century:0 "A Russian Century"
 RUS_A_Russian_Century_desc:0 "The nation rejoices!\n\nAfter so much fighting and bloodletting, it has been achieved. We have accelerated the downfall of the German Reich. Our forefathers are standing behind us, our fathers with us, and our sons in front of us. We have the spirit of all of Russia and its glorious future all around us. There is just one more hurdle to cross before we grasp the great victory that is owed to us. We grip it with power, strength, and might. We shall watch each one of the so called masterace choke on their own blood as they are taken by the Russian wave."

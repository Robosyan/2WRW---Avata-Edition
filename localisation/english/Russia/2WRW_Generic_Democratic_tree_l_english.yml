 RUS_WRW_Generic_Democratic_tree: "Democratic War Tree"
 RUS_Freedum_tt: "We are one nation again!"
 RUS_Lets_Go: "Let's Go!"
 RUS_Freedom: "United and Free!"
 RUS_Freedom_desc: "[RUSGetUniqueNamePlain]. For the first time in decades, after a struggle unheard of in Russian history we are one state again. Never will there be another dark age as long as we march under [ROOT.GetLeader]'s banner - yet imminent challenges loom closer now that we have emerged victorious, threatening our reborn 1917.\n\n. Kazakhstan and the Steppe remain wary of our presence, having been trapped in the old Union for so long after its de facto collapse. Oppression runs rife in Outer Manchuria, ripped away from us by the opportunistic Japanese. And Russia's greatest failure taunts us to the west in the form of a ruined Moskva. We will not stand by idly while all of this oppression continues to rage around us.\n\n§aOne way or another, all of Russia will be free§!."
 RUS_Lets_Go_tt: "The reclamation of [RUSGetUniqueNamePlain]'s §xstolen territory§! from the §oGerman Reich§! will commence"
 RUS_Lets_Go_desc: "After what's seemed like generations of pain and struggle, we have forged a united and democratic Russia. The cycle of tyrannical rule from one political extreme to the other has finally been undone. However, we can not stop here. Millions of Russia’s sons and daughters still toil under the jackboot. All the while, the home of the Rus and its culture are being tarnished by its occupiers.\n\nIt is time to rally the troops, man the guns, and make our battle plans as we embark on our final crusade. Our people shall be more emboldened than ever before, for they will fight this war not for the sake of their autocratic Tsar nor hypocritical political extremists. They will fight this war for the sake of themselves and their freedom. With vigor in hearts and one goal in our minds, we shall march west and fight for the dream of a truly free Russia."
 RUS_A_War_of_Liberation: "A War of Liberation"
 RUS_A_War_of_Liberation_desc: "As the first shots are being fired and casualties reports begin to trickle in, we must never forget our noble cause: our cause of building a Russia that is free from tyranny and occupation. We fight and die in this war for the liberation of all Russians. The coming months will be hard; families will be broken and lives forever ruined. But the cost of freedom will be worth it. It has to be worth it.\n\nFor the sake of liberty, we will march until every Russian is freed from their German chains. We shall carry the torch of freedom and liberty westward, its light giving hope to the enslaved and imprisoned. We’ve gotten this far; we must see this to the end. With Moscow growing closer in our sights, the eyes of the free world are on us, we shall not leave their hopes and dreams wanting."
 RUS_Establish_a_Wartime_Economy: "Establish a Wartime Economy"
 RUS_Establish_a_Wartime_Economy_desc: "During the Second World War, Bukharin’s economic plans completely broke down and never recovered after the Germans began their blitz through Russia’s heartlands. We will not make the same mistakes. With these hindsights in mind and aided by the hands of our motivated populace, our factories will never stop churning out materials for our war of liberation. The smoke billowing from our complex’s chimneys will only cease once freedom’s light finally shines over the spires of St. Basil’s Cathedral.\n\nThanks to the monetary backing of our friends in the OFN and like-minded nations, we can add coal to the engine that is our economy long enough to see victory through. The failures of Bukharinism shall be absolved with our victory; it is all a matter of time and sacrifice, and we Russians are intimately more familiar with this than anyone."
 RUS_Lead_Ahead_Valiant_Sons: "Lead Ahead, Valiant Sons!"
 RUS_Lead_Ahead_Valiant_Sons_desc: "While we are off to a decent start, what we are still lacking is a larger surplus of men and women to hold the rifles we are pumping out. This shouldn’t be hard to address; even if our nation isn’t completely whole, there are still millions of Russians within our reach that can be convinced to do their duty in liberating their ancestral homeland.\n\nFrom Arkhangelsk to Magadan, we shall send recruiters and draft letters to all able-bodied sons and daughters of Russia to sign up and join the fight. Perhaps we can also convince some friends in the fellow free nations to encourage emigrés to return home and aid in our struggle. Felling the dark hordes of fascism will be a daunting task, but if we all stand together and fight for our right to exist, even the Heer shall fall before the might of our liberation army!"
 RUS_The_Wehrmacht_Rots: "The Wehrmacht Rots"
 RUS_The_Wehrmacht_Rots_desc: "After our first initial pushes westward, we have come to realize that the Wehrmacht is woefully outmatched in most regions despite our initial estimates. Whether we grossly overestimated the German army’s abilities or internal instability in Germany itself is playing a role, we will not stand idle with this newfound knowledge.\n\nEven now, our soldiers are chewing up any German resistance they find and, in some cases literally, are asking us for a second serving. The news of consistent victories has raised morale both at home and on the front lines and as such, our factories are seeing better performance and lines grow longer outside our recruitment centers. In a beautifully twisted and ironic sense, it seems that this entire time the German army was just a rotting structure, all we had to do was to just kick its door down…"
 RUS_On_the_Cusp_of_Liberty: "On the Cusp of Liberty"
 RUS_On_the_Cusp_of_Liberty_desc: "This is it. The eyes of the free world are on us and are holding their breath as the war reaches closer and closer to the German border. The enemy is on their last legs, mounting what little desperate defense they can muster in the vain hopes to stave off the tide of our valiant troops. People at home and abroad are already celebrating what very well might be our coming victory, which is why now is the time for one last push. One last offensive to drive our hateful oppressors back to their masters with defeat looming over their spirits.\n\nThis is the enemy's last stand. When we accomplish this last offensive, we can go home and rebuild what was taken from us. Decades of strife and humiliation shall be undone. We will be the light that finally shines over Eastern Europe after decades of German rule. Just one last push, and the dream of liberty and freedom for the people of Rus shall finally be cemented into the annals of history!"
 SWRW_democratic_partisan_uprising_tt: "§xPartisan activities§! will begin across [RUSGetEasternEuropeNames]"
 RUS_Eastern_Europe_Breathes: "Eastern Europe Breathes"
 RUS_Eastern_Europe_Breathes_desc: "It is finally over. As Russia’s last war finally comes to a close, we shall honor the lost souls that gave their lives in defense of the dream of democracy in Russia. As Central Europe begins to descend further into turmoil due to our victory, we will begin to rebuild and reconsolidate now that we can live freely without Germany breathing down our necks.\n\nThe torch of liberty now shines brightly from [RUSGetWesternmostCity] to Kamchatka. We have endured our baptism of fire and finally we can break the wheel of totalitarian tradition. With this victory, we have shown the world that Russia can be led by her people and her people alone. We have fought and won for this dream, now we walk hand in hand to a new and brighter era in Russia’s history. The Second Time of Troubles is now over; let us begin our new age of prosperity with democracy’s light guiding our way forward."

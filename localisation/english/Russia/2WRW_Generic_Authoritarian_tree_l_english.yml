 RUS_WRW_Generic_Authoritarian_tree: "Authoritarian War Tree"
 RUS_United_Forever_tt: "We are one nation again!"
 RUS_United_Forever: "United Forever"
 RUS_United_Forever_desc: "[RUSGetUniqueNamePlain]. For the first time in decades, after a struggle unheard of in Russian history we are one state again. Never will there be another dark age as long as we march under [ROOT.GetLeader]'s banner - yet much needs to be done to secure the state's power.\n\nThe foolish Kazakhs, faithful for so long to a dead Union, have found themselves ripped apart by its bureaucracy. The Japanese have stolen Outer Manchuria from our clutches, denying us our eastern bulwark of Vladivostok. And Germania still taunts us from afar, holding our ancestral homelands hostage. The world must be returned to its natural state of affairs.\n\n§xFor [ROOT.GetLeader] wills it so§!."
 RUS_Our_War_of_Strength: "Our War of Strength"
 RUS_Our_War_of_Strength_tt: "The reclamation of [RUSGetUniqueNamePlain]'s §xstolen territory§! from the §oGerman Reich§! will commence"
 RUS_Our_War_of_Strength_desc: "The German is a foolhardy beast. Their tendency to name all of those who rightfully oppose their barbarous actions as “Untermensch” does not faze our noble people. Our people who have stood against greater foes than the Reich time and time again and triumphed. The Mongols, the Tatars, the Poles and Lithuanians, the Swedes, the Ottomans, even Napoleon’s army have all been bested by our cunning!\n\nToday, we again fight for what our ancestors have fought and bled for through the centuries: The banishment of yet another foreign oppressor from our territory! The spirit of the Rurikids, of Nevsky, of Catherine the Great all run through every proud [RUS.GetAdjective]’s blood, for they all know that this war is not just for glory, not just for national pride, but for the future of the nation itself!"
 RUS_Strongarm_the_Populace: "Strongarm the Populace"
 RUS_Strongarm_the_Populace_desc: "As our war machine marches on, brave [RUS.GetAdjective] lives are lost and [RUS.GetAdjective] equipment is destroyed. Of course, most proud [RUS.GetAdjective]s see the necessity of these losses in the grander scheme of our brave and righteous struggle, but there are those in our society who see otherwise. Even with our victory surely on the horizon, degenerates wrongly assume that our losses outweigh the positives of continuing our fight against the Germanic scum.\n\nThese fools, calling for a white peace or even surrender, must not be allowed to taint the integrity of the war effort. Dissident strikes will be cracked down on with lethal force and a media blackout will be instituted to prevent further infiltration by such traitors. With this, we can only hope that now the public will be more receptive to our struggle."
 RUS_Expand_the_MIC: "Expand the Military-Industrial Complex"
 RUS_Expand_the_MIC_desc: "The backbone of any armed conflict is the steel and sweat of factories. Without a strong industry and a steady flow of equipment, militaries wither away and fall to inferior enemies in spite of greater manpower and stronger morale. We cannot allow [RUSGetUniqueNamePlain] to succumb to such a fate, and we cannot be afraid to take any measures necessary to prevent it.\n\n[RUSGetUniqueNameTitle] is already at a disadvantage to Germany with decades of Luftwaffe bombings and war crippling our economy. To keep our soldier's well supplied, we must bolster funding for contracts with military corporations and, if need be, nationalize industry key to the war effort. Wrestling Eastern Europe away from the Nazi Jackboot must be the highest priority for the nation, and the only way to see victory over the Reich is with superiority of arms."
 RUS_Forwards_for_Russia: "Forwards, For [RUSGetUniqueNameTitle]!"
 RUS_Forwards_for_Russia_desc: "None in [RUSGetUniqueNamePlain] were blind to the daunting reality of this war. We are fighting a well armed, well trained enemy with a strong will and might. However, our Motherland has more than held its own against the Reich, with objective after objective being reclaimed in the name of our proud people! The propaganda front has also been a major success, with most of the men and women not able to serve happily producing the equipment that our brave soldiers desperately need.\n\nIt goes without saying that our righteous war is well on its way to a victorious conclusion, in no small part because of the everyday [RUS.GetAdjective] people, with even our former naysayers unable to deny our success. The end of the Reich is near! Onwards, comrades!"
 RUS_Ubermensch_No_More: "Ubermensch No More"
 RUS_Ubermensch_No_More_desc: "The Hooked Cross burns across the Ruthenian steppes, with the degenerates holding it facing no mercy in surrender to our glorious Motherland. It is said that before Operation Barbarossa, that old bastard Hitler, whose corpse still haunts us to this day, remarked that the door to our nation needed only to be kicked in, with the entire rotting structure crumbling down afterwards. With our victory all but assured we have proved that the adage goes both ways, as the German war machine has truly begun to crumble in on itself.\n\nOur never-ending assaults have utterly decimated German morale, with formerly patriotic Germans joining a rapidly expanding anti-war movement in their own homeland. The gates to Berlin are being opened, and it is only a matter of time before we cross the threshold!"
 RUS_Rout_the_Bastards: "Rout the Bastards!"
 RUS_Rout_the_Bastards_desc: "With our glorious victory in Moskowien appearing more and more inevitable by the hour, the German horde has begun to shatter into a million pieces. The Reich's Generals have started surrendering en masse to our army, and the Nazi ranks continue to crumble.\n\nWith our soldiers advancing further and further into the Reichskommissariats and the Huns soundly on the backfoot, it is only a matter of time before we will reach the German heartland itself, destroying not only the German Fatherland's honor and prestige on the world stage but the will of its very people, at last avenging what they did to our Motherland so many decades ago."
 RUS_The_Reich_in_Ashes: "The Reich in Ashes"
 RUS_The_Reich_in_Ashes_desc: "Three decades ago, Russia was plunged into an age of devastation and calamity. Three decades ago, the future of our nation was stolen by a barbarous, loathsome state built on the backs of our slavic brethren's enslavement and extinction. Three decades ago, the fools of Bukharin's Union fell to the armies of Hitler and the Reich.\n\nToday, the Swastika lies broken and engulfed in a flame of its own creation. The Kremlin is free of occupation and our banner flies proud and defiant atop its domes. [RUSGetUniqueNameTitle] looked to the German behemoth as a war torn and broken nation. We dared to declare that their crimes would no longer stand. We marched across Europe, through fields and cities, rivers and forests, and we accomplished a feat that not the Americans, not the British, nor even the Soviets could:\n\nWe won."

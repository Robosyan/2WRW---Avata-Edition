 ceSWRW.1.t:0 "The Fall of Theodorichshafen"
 ceSWRW.1.desc:0 "In a magnificent turn of events, reports are coming in that the [RUS.GetAdjective] Army has solidified its control of the city of Theodorichshafen. Initially encircling the city, the [RUS.GetAdjective]s began a brutal siege, during which [RUS.GetAdjective] artillery bombarded naval and shipping ports to prevent supplies from entering the city via transport ship. By the time the [RUS.GetAdjective]s finally assaulted the city, the battered and beleaguered German defenders could put up little resistance. What was left of German high command in the city has reportedly fled across the water in hopes of reaching the mainland to continue the fight elsewhere.\nThe jewel of German occupied Crimea, Theodorichshafen served as the primary port for Kriegsmarine operations in the Black Sea. The city also acted as the largest hub of Germans on the Peninsula, with nearly the entire city consisting of German settlers and Kriegsmarine officers.\nThe [RUS.GetAdjective] government has proclaimed the renaming of the city back to its original name of Sevastopol, and have begun the distribution of pro [RUS.GetAdjective] flyers in the streets.\n\nAll Germans have been placed on a strict curfew, and all slaves captured by [RUS.GetAdjective] Armed forces have been set free. As the city lies in ruin, the [RUS.GetAdjective] government now must decide what to do with Sevastopol, and the Crimean peninsula as a whole.\nWith Slavs now as the minority, the task of reintegrating Crimea into the new [RUS.GetAdjective] state won't be easy, and is expected to be a violent ordeal. Local Germans have already begun resistance operations against the [RUS.GetAdjective] occupiers, destroying key infrastructure needed to access Sevastopol and the rest of the peninsula. German high command has announced plans to retake the city and reestablish Kreigsmarine presence in the Black Sea.\n\nYet for now, Sevastopol lies in [RUS.GetAdjective] hands. With it, [RUSGetUniqueNamePlain]'s grip on the Black Sea has been made absolute, as German naval forces have completely fled to the Baltic Sea. Experts are still uncertain of the wars course, but everyone understands that this is a great victory for [RUSGetUniqueNamePlain], and a crushing blow for the Reich. "

 ceSWRW.2.t:0 "The Fall of Riga"
 ceSWRW.2.desc:0 "After weeks of brutal marching across Ostland, the [RUS.GetAdjective] Army has finally captured the port city of Riga. The city's defense was undermined by the lethargic remnants of the Wehrmacht, many of which fled across the Daugava River rather than face the oncoming tide of [RUS.GetAdjective] soldiers. Instead, Riga was defended largely by a motley assortment of militiamen and Hitler Youth. These ramshackle Volkssturm units were entirely combat ineffective, and the [RUS.GetAdjective] Army reports that over ninety percent have been killed or captured.\n\nIn the chaos of the Battle for Riga, a brief alliance of Latvian Nationalists and former UPO freedom fighters slipped into the city, sabotaging key supply areas and eventually assassinating the city's Staatskommissar. Due to unclear lines of succession, the Rigan High Command fell into chaos, and after days of infighting the beleaguered Junior Undersecretary of the Ostland NSDAP surrendered the city to the [RUS.GetAdjective]s.\n\nThe capture of Riga has been a major national embarrassment for the beleaguered Großgermanisches Reich. Citizens of various Einheitspakt aligned and neutral nations have been forced to flee across the Baltic to Sweden, prompting condemnations of the war's conduct from their governments. Many prominent NSDAP officials have been captured by the [RUS.GetAdjective] army, and are now being transported to the [RUS.GetAdjective] capital to face trial for their crimes.\n\nRiga was the beating heart of Hitler's empire in the Baltics. The city was not only an economic giant, but also served as a major supply hub for the Kriegsmarine in the Baltic Sea. The German Empire's control of the region was tenuous before the war began, and with the loss of such a critical lynchpin it is unlikely that the Nazis will hold the area in their iron grip much longer. Dozens of groups ranging from far-right Nationalists to Landrut liberals to Communists are already urging the [RUS.GetAdjective]s to recognize their government in the bloodied remains of the Ostland Colony. The German hegemony over the area has been shattered forever.\n\nThe door to Prussia, and beyond it the slavering heart of the German beast, now lies open."

 ceSWRW.3.t:0 "The Fall of Smolensk"
 ceSWRW.3.desc:0 "Despite the best efforts of the Wehrmacht, the city of Smolensk has fallen to the invading [RUS.GetAdjective] army. The frontlines only reached Smolensk recently, after weeks of gruesome warfare transformed the Moscow theater into a slog through corpse-choked mud. The infamous 51st Panzerkorps led the defense of the city alongside numerous professional and militia infantry formations. Unfortunately for the Nazis, the 51st found itself unable to reproduce its earlier successes in the [RUS.GetAdjective] terrain, as vicious rain turned the field of battle into an endless pit of thick, tarry mud. The numerous German tanks found themselves mired in filth, unable to maneuver or defend themselves. A series of lightning strikes by anti-tank specialists- some suicidal in their nature- ripped the fragile tank formations to shreds, allowing the [RUS.GetAdjective] army to overwhelm the city's defenses.\n\nThe [RUS.GetAdjective] victory was compounded by the liberation of a concentration camp located to the west of the city's border. Numerous individuals, including [RUS.GetAdjective] and Polish slaves, Jews, former Zorinist partisans, and even several senior members of the von Saucken revolt have been rescued from conditions described by the [RUS.GetAdjective] commander as "inhumanly evil". Photos of the camp are already circulating throughout the Sphere and the OFN, both of which have offered severe condemnations of the Reich's colonial policies.\n\nThe capture of Smolensk sounds the death toll for Reichkommissariat Moskowien at the very least, if not even greater swathes of the German colonial sphere. With the loss of the city, the Reich has completely lost control over the western approach to Moscow. The German strategy has failed, and the Wehrmacht now has little to no ability to project power eastward. The vast [RUS.GetAdjective] army has now secured control over the territory of [RUSGetUniqueNamePlain] proper. Unless the Wehrmacht succeeds in forcing a significant reversal, it is now likely that the war will end with Moscow and the surrounding territories returning to the [RUS.GetAdjective] government.\n\nWith the western border of Moskowien now controlled by [RUSGetUniqueNamePlain], further campaigns into Ostland and the north of Ukraine are now not only feasible but likely. Perhaps, with this action, the war has now come within a measurable distance of its end."

 ceSWRW.4.t:0 "The Fall of Paulusburg"
 ceSWRW.4.desc:0 "After intense fighting in the city of Paulusburg, it has been confirmed that the [RUS.GetAdjective] army triumphed over the German defenders, repelling them from the city and raising the proud banner of the Motherland in the heart of the Volga city. After crossing the vast Volga River, [RUS.GetAdjective] divisions were swift in storming the city, overwhelming the German defenders as the [RUS.GetAdjective] air force began a bombing campaign over the city, raining hell upon the hastily built fortifications from the skies above. The German High Command quickly fled the city before the city command centre had been captured by [RUS.GetAdjective] special forces, marking a [RUS.GetAdjective] victory.\n\nThe heart of the Volga River, the city of Paulusburg was an industrial centre and served as the capital of the Volga region and was one of the first major West [RUS.GetAdjective] cities to be colonised by German settlers with the remaining [RUS.GetAdjective] landmarks left rotting and broken, a dark reminder of the Soviet Unions failure in the Great Patriotic War.\n\nThe [RUS.GetAdjective] government declared its intension to revive the [RUS.GetAdjective] identity in the city, renaming the city Volgograd, spreading pro-[RUS.GetAdjective] propaganda throughout the city and reintroducing [RUS.GetAdjective] as the official language. German neighbourhoods are under strict martial law with reports of brutality and lynching of Germans, carried out by the empowered former [RUS.GetAdjective] slaves while local German militias form in the outskirts of the city to fight against the advancing [RUS.GetAdjective] army, sabotaging key infrastructure and [RUS.GetAdjective] military equipment.\n\nThe Wehrmacht has declared to retake the heart of the Volga-German region but for now, the city lies firmly in [RUS.GetAdjective] hands as the once divided Volga River basin lies under the complete domination of [RUSGetUniqueNamePlain]. Experts are still uncertain of the wars course, but all are in agreement that this is a great victory for [RUSGetUniqueNamePlain] and a crushing blow for the Reich."

 ceSWRW.5.t:0 "The Fall of Kiev"
 ceSWRW.5.desc:0 "In what many future historians will likely consider being the Penultimate battles of the war, Kiev has fallen to [RUS.GetAdjective] troops. Following many defeats east of the city, the city itself was defended by whatever German units that have survived the [RUS.GetAdjective] onslaught, which were sabotaged at every turn by local Ukrainian resistance who were galvanised by recent [RUS.GetAdjective] victories in the east. Much like in the battle of Moscow, German troops attempted to hold the right bank of Kiev, defending the Dnieper from any crossing, only to be beaten back by the now clearly superior [RUS.GetAdjective] military. When the city was announced to be clear, the city's Slavic population turned out to welcome the [RUS.GetAdjective]s in full.\n\nWhile the population are jubilant seeing their German rulers evicted from the ancient seat of Eastern Slavic Civilization, questions among the Ukrainian public have begun to be asked about Ukraine's future. Some call for complete independence and entering a defensive pact with [RUSGetUniqueNamePlain], scant few call for complete assimilation into [RUSGetUniqueNamePlain], and the myriad of other voices between those two points have come to light now that the majority of Ukraine has been liberated. Nonetheless, many Ukrainian groups have agreed to hold off on agitating for any particular path until the German threat is completely and utterly defeated.\n\nOutside of Ukraine, the [RUS.GetAdjective] army's victory in fighting for Kiev has been remarked as perhaps one of the final death blows needed to bring the Germans to the negotiations table. As a result, many scholars and pundits have turned away from the question of "Can [RUSGetUniqueNamePlain] win?" and now ask," How will [RUS.GetAdjective] rule reshape Europe?"\n\nA notable exception has been within Germany, whose government remains steadfast in their claim that the loss of Kiev is a temporary setback. However, even among the most adamant of the Regimes supporters, doubt has fully set in, and political actors across Europe are planning for their departure from Germany. "

Along with areas around it, the hard fighting through the mountain ranges of the Caucasus continue to rage on as the [RUS.GetAdjective]s reclaim the black gold they once possessed. The port city itself allowed for some German troops to row off to some of the other smaller outlying islands.\n\nWith the loss of Caucasus oil, the already precarious position Germany found itself in has been made even worse; having been cut off from Romanian oil only a few years prior.\nMoreover, the gateway to the Middle-East is now firmly in [RUS.GetAdjective] hands; leading to many wondering when Iran cuts off their oil supply to the Germans too. With Germany's economic future plunged into uncertainty, who knows how the German populace will react?\n\nFor now, we know only three things for certain: the Panzers have been halted, the Luftwaffe grounded and the Kriegsmarine anchored."

 ceSWRW.7.t:0 "The Fall of Sankt Petersburg"
 ceSWRW.7.desc:0 "Long ago the city of Sankt Petersburg had fallen into German hands, after years of siege. Millions had died, millions of Slavic people who had once fully populated the city perished in the cruel siege. The city was razed, and room was made for German settlers. Today, under the heel of [RUS.GetAdjective] invaders, the city returns to [RUS.GetAdjective] control.\n\nThe soldiers made their way through the slums were the last few Slavs remained, to the edge of the Baltic Sea where the German settlers lived. The fall of this city has been a striking blow to the stability of German's eastern colony, and the [RUS.GetAdjective]s do not plan to stop at just Sankt Petersburg. The Eagle's empire over the East is beginning its gradual collapse, as the [RUS.GetAdjective]s rip and tear their empire apart.\n\nA problem with the [RUS.GetAdjective] control of the city sits in the air however, as the city is heavily Germanised as a result of civilian casualties in World War II  and the Nazi doctrine of Lebensraum making room for German settlers to flood into the city. It's not like the city could be Slavic majority again without some mass forced movements, or even worse, complete slaughter, but is that inhumane or not? That is a question only the [RUS.GetAdjective] liberators can answer."

With the size and strength of the partisans, the [RUS.GetAdjective] army always seemed 2 steps ahead of the Wehrmacht and the colonial garrison.\n\nEncircled inside the city, the 22nd panzer division, supported by colonial regiments tried their best to stop the [RUS.GetAdjective] advance; holding out for an impressive amount of time while turning the city into a pile of rubble.\n\nThe peoples of the Caucasus welcome the [RUS.GetAdjective]s for now, and partisan groups have decided to lay their arms down for now as a show of gratitude towards the thousands of [RUS.GetAdjective]s that died liberating their homeland from the oppression of Nazism. Calls for independence remain, but for now, the Georgian people are pleased to be able to pronounce the name of their city once again."

 ceSWRW.9.t:0 "The Fall of Arkhangelsk"
 ceSWRW.9.desc:0 "Surprising news has come from the [RUS.GetAdjective] front, as the port city of Arkhangelsk has been captured in a joint operation of the Kriegsmarine and the Wehrmacht. Several recently reactivated Kriegsmarine Stoßtrupp Battalions led the attack from the sea, infiltrating the city's port, sabotaging naval vessels, and compromising key defensive areas. Despite heavy casualties the marines were able to complete their objectives in less than four hours of brutal fighting. The Wehrmacht then began shelling the city and [RUS.GetAdjective] military positions from the western approach in an effort to force a crossing of the Dvina river. After nearly three days of artillery fire, the Wehrmacht deployed numerous EFA amphibious bridges, allowing several battalions of lightly equipped infantry to cross the Dvina and enter the city. The [RUS.GetAdjective] army was ultimately unable to resist, and the city surrendered after days of murderous house to house fighting.\n\nThe capture of Arkhangelsk is a significant blow to the [RUS.GetAdjective] war effort. Although no longer the political capital of the defunct West [RUS.GetAdjective] Revolutionary Front, Arkhangelsk remained both strategically and economically important as one of the few functioning major ports in Western [RUSGetUniqueNamePlain]. The small [RUS.GetAdjective] navy is unlikely to be able to continue to challenge the Kreigsmarine in the White Sea without control of the city. Rationing in the [RUS.GetAdjective] territories is now likely to become more severe, as important consumer goods once imported from the OFN or Co Prosperity Sphere will now have to travel by land through the port of Magadan in the Far East. While the war is far from concluded, the fall of Arkhangelsk has decisively shifted the momentum of the war behind the National Socialist juggernaut. Key positions in the Ural mountains, as well as the remnants of the [RUS.GetAdjective] heartland, are now exposed to possible Wehrmacht offensives. Without a significant and immediate reversal, it is likely that history will remember this battle as the end of an independent and sovereign [RUSGetUniqueNamePlain]."

 ceSWRW.10.desc:0 "Despite overwhelming odds, reports from the [RUS.GetAdjective] front confirm that the city of Syktyvkar has been captured by the German Army. Once thought to be unassailable due to the presence of an enormous stockpile of chemical weapons, the center of the former Komi ASSR was robbed of its primary defense when an unexpected air raid collapsed the entrance to the Syktyvkar Arsenal. The Wehrmacht began its assault on the city within hours, forcing the [RUS.GetAdjective]s to rely on conventional weapons to defend themselves. Before the Germans were able to breach the city's perimeter, numerous criminal groups and ad-hoc militias associated with the former parties of the Komi Republic organized to defend their city. Eurasians, Ultravisionaries, Sovereign Democrats, and even survivors of Sergei Taboritsky's OVRI took up defensive positions together to resist the incoming Nazi army. While they fought bravely, their efforts were not enough. After a violent last stand in the National Museum of the Komi Republic, the remnants of [RUS.GetAdjective] armed forces in the city were crushed.\n\nThe [RUS.GetAdjective] government alleges that the Wehrmacht has engaged in widespread retaliatory violence against the civilian populace of Syktyvkar. Many survivors report killings of the families of militia and army members, as well as destruction of property, sexual assaults, and seizure of homes to quarter German personnel. Aerial photographs confirm that nearly forty percent of the city has been leveled. The Komi minority is also allegedly being targeted, with some reports suggesting deportations from the frontlines to an unknown fate in Eastern Europe. The German Foreign Office has refused to respond to these allegations.\n\nInternational observers doubt that the [RUS.GetAdjective] government will be able to effectively resist the German Reich much longer. The city of Syktyvkar is located deep in the territory of Western [RUSGetUniqueNamePlain]. At minimum, the southern approach to Ukhta and the security of the Urals have been heavily compromised. At worst, the loss of a crucial supply hub will result in the conquest of all Western [RUSGetUniqueNamePlain]. Military experts do not believe the [RUS.GetAdjective] military will be able to effectively counter further German incursions at this time. A German victory is now assured- the only question is how much land they will be able to seize."

Additionally, as the town sits at the mouth of the Volga river, it serves as a critical launching point into the German-held Caucuses.\n\nIf the [RUS.GetAdjective] army can maintain momentum, it could mean cutting the germans off from the limited amount of fuel that has so far meant keeping the Reich afloat since the Oil crisis and sending the Reich into a death spiral. Only time will tell if this is a minor setback for the Reich or the beginning of the end of the empire that has held Europe under its Iron Boot for the past several decades.\n\nAs for the city itself, the local population welcomed the [RUS.GetAdjective] troops with celebrations. The elderly of the town speak of what they lost when the Germans first came; the oppressed peoples of the city from slaves to the small Buddhist population exchange gratitude with men that they see as liberators; and the young of the town have started to attempt to join the [RUS.GetAdjective] army in an attempt to liberate the rest of Europe from the German's Grasp.\n\nFor the rest of the world, This news has brought a great sense of reality to the situation now developing throughout Eastern Europe.

These well equipped, highly disciplined companies rallied to defend the last bastion of [RUS.GetAdjective] sovereignty in Western Siberia. When the Wehrmacht finally entered the city, they were greeted by a mass of press-ganged civilian suicide bombers. Armored columns attempting to navigate numerous roadblocks were destroyed by improvised explosive devices, while infantry and even medical corps were targeted with vicious and constant sniper fire. After a week of harassment and high casualties, the commander of the Wehrmacht division in Omsk was captured and crucified by the [RUS.GetAdjective] forces.\n\nFollowing this humiliation, the German High Command authorized the deployment of a low grade nuclear weapon to destroy the city in its entirety. All German units were withdrawn from Omsk's perimeter within eight hours, as none had penetrated beyond the city outskirts. NachtjagdgGeschwader 5 overtook the city at 01:34 and deployed the weapon, codenamed 'Naglfar', from a height of 31,000 feet. The bomb struck 960 feet from General Boris Steklyar's impromptu headquarters, annihilating both the defending Black League and all civilization within two miles of the blast radius. Fires begun by the heat of the blast destroyed a further seventy percent of the city.\n\nAlthough the Japanese and American governments were informed of the impending launch prior to the attack, as well as its destination, reports suggest that both Sphere and OFN nuclear assets were activated to respond to a German First Strike launch.

German commanders were perplexed to find that the city's administrative and industrial  centers had been moved nearly entirely underground by order of Lazar Kaganovich nearly fifteen years ago, thus eliminating the possibility of aerial bombardment tactics the Germans have relied upon heavily throughout the war. Elements of the former People's Republic had transformed the tunnels and burrows of the city into death traps. Flooding of key passageways, ambushes, and even primitive boobytraps such as pitfalls filled with iron spikes resulted in horrific casualties for the attacking Germans. Low priority infantry continued to attempt to claim victory in Tyumen while armored elements and Veteran divisions continued further into [RUSGetUniqueNamePlain]. After a period of several weeks, the German commanding officer authorized the use of poison gas captured from Syktyvkar to clear the city, killing the defenders and much of the remaining civilian population.\n\nThe Battle of Tyumen has been a Pyrrhic victory for the German Reich, at best. The loss of such a severe number of personnel has no doubt bloodied the General Staff's nose. The majority of Tyumen's industry was destroyed by Stalinist partisans during the defense of the city, preventing the enormous ironworks and numerous tank factories from falling into National Socialist hands. German propaganda has nonetheless described the battle as "a clear victory of Aryan ingenuity over the Slavs". The commander of the battle has reportedly been nominated for the Iron Cross, even as hundreds of conscripts are shuttled to Germania in body bags.\n\nDespite the [RUS.GetAdjective]s' heroic defense of their city, it is unlikely that this effort will make a difference. The ultimate outcome of the war has not been in question for some time. It is clear that, with the loss of the natural defenses of the Ural mountains and the deep penetration of Wehrmacht personnel into Siberia, the Germans may seize whatever wealth and resources they wish from the starving corpse of a once proud nation."

They did not, and indeed could not, offer a sincere defense of the vast metropolis. But Novosibirsk's sons and daughters did not fail her. Remnants of the Federation Air Force found themselves stranded to the East of Novosibirsk, and used their last fuel in a series of daring attack runs on the invading Wehrmacht. As the Heer had overstretched themselves, charging ahead of their air support in a vain attempt to secure victory, casualties among the German columns were enormous.  Yet, once the remaining jet fuel was exhausted, Novosibirsk and her people could not be saved. The bloodied German invasion force entered the city like jackals, killing thousands and maiming even more. The sac culminated in the burning of the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, and the public strangulation of the city's mayor.\n\nWith this brute action, one of the largest population centers of Free [RUSGetUniqueNamePlain] has fallen under the German heel.

In the aftermath of the collapse of the [RUS.GetAdjective] frontlines, a brigade of ex-NKVD personnel seized control of the city and began to organize its inhabitants into militia and home defense regiments. These survivors of the Magnitogorsk regime, hardened by the warlord era and decades of veterancy, were expected to put up a stiff fight against the Heer soldiers sent to take Chelyabinsk. However, the NKVD men seemed to have expected more time to prepare the city's defenses, and were caught off guard by a midnight assault of the 53rd Panzerkorps. With little time to rouse the militias, the Germans were able to push into the heart of Chelyabinsk and subdue much of the city's population before massacring the NKVD personnel and any sympathizers.\n\nInternational observers have reported the complete demolition of both the South Ural and Chelyabinsk State Universities. Worse still, some allege that political prisoners and suspected prisoners were detained in the South Ural University buildings before being burnt alive in their scholastic prisons. Decades of [RUS.GetAdjective] scientific progress have been destroyed. The tools and minds that may have ushered in a technological Renaissance now lie shattered, crushed by the blackheeled jackboot of the Third Reich.

The capture of the city was not a military operation; it was a brutal, mindless sack, having more in common with the Mongol invasion of the Khwarzemids than any act of modern warfare. As the Wehrmacht entered the city, countless artistic and scientific wonders were seized by marauding German infantrymen, many ripped from the hands of their owners at gunpoint. The Tomsk History Museum, the Museum of Archeology and Ethnography, and Tomsk State University have been burnt to ash and cinders. The city's intellectual elite have been seized en-masse and imprisoned.

An action was planned, in secret, to ensure the sovereignty of a new Tatar Republic. As the Wehrmacht approached the city, Tatar conscripts and officers abandoned their posts en masse. Thousands of AWOL soldiers blended into crowds, hid in ghettos, and fled from Kazan, leaving the city almost defenseless. The [RUS.GetAdjective] commander, recognizing the numeric and tactical supremacy of the incoming German armada, ordered a full retreat, stopping only to evacuate supplies and several senior government officials. The Wehrmacht arrived days later on the border of the Free City of Kazan. Senior Tatar officials met with the German commander, offering supplies, free passage, and military collaboration in return for German recognition of a Tatar state in West [RUSGetUniqueNamePlain].\n\nThe proposed collaboration between the genocidal anti-Asian National Socialists and the firm ranks of Tatar nationalists has been controversial, to say the least. A faction of Tatar socialists and liberals led by Ibragim Mingzeyev have aggressively denounced the action, with some going so far as to throw shoes and toilet paper at representatives of the new government. Many have said that the action has sullied the legacy of Abdulla Alis; others simply recognize that the Germans are not the lesser of two evils. Street violence and political crime has grown more common in Kazan since the declaration of the Free City. Mothers, fathers, and lovers of peace wait in terror for the [RUS.GetAdjective] counterattack. Or will it be Tatar who sheds Tatar blood?\n\nWhile the situation in the proposed Tatar Republic is yet to be determined, the outcome of this mass action is clear.

As the Heer forced the [RUS.GetAdjective] Armed forces to retreat from positions in the Urals, a hastily armed militia led by one Lev Nikolayevich Krasnopevtsev seized the city and declared the inauguration of the West Siberian People's Union, a reorganized, anti-revisionist Leninist government with alleged authority over the entire region. The retreating [RUS.GetAdjective] Army fought back against Krasnopevtsev's forces, and had repacified nearly two-thirds of the city before the Heer arrived on its doorstep. With Sverdlovsk divided between loyal army divisions and Krasnopevtsev's mutineers, neither side was able to effectively resist the Wehrmacht. After several weeks of house-to-house fighting, the commander of the German forces announced his victory over the defenders from the steps of the Central Military District headquarters.\n\nThe German victory has come at a heavy cost to the people of Sverdlovsk.

Civilian and military casualties caused by the occupation of Sverdlovsk are yet to be calculated, but are expected to reach the tens of thousands.\n\nThe fall of Sverdlovsk indicates that the fall of West Siberia is imminent, if not complete at this time.

Further advances into [RUSGetUniqueNamePlain] were conducted by infantry equipped with skis and mountain climbing equipment, which made their way on foot from the frontlines to the grim fortresses of Vorkuta.

Now, the roar of tanks and the crack of gunfire could also be heard. There was no longer any sliver of doubt. The [RUS.GetAdjective]s had come.\n\nCracking open ancient caches of rifles, the ghosts of an era long forgotten slowly began emerging from the skeleton of the city. Wojciech had fought the Germans with the Home Army a lifetime ago. He had risen up with Fieldorf when the Reich had been thrown into anarchy, and when the blood-soaked jackboot of the Führer came crashing back down, he had scurried into darkness once more. The Germans were fond of calling them cockroaches, and today, they would realise just how right they were.\n\nAs [RUS.GetAdjective] tanks barreled furiously down the streets of the city, Wojciech and his comrades emerged onto what was once Floriańska Street. Rubble and corpses littered the street, flanked by tall buildings, completely hollowed out by the flames of war. Continuing towards the centre of the old town, the small band felt the chaos swell around them, as machine guns exchanged fire across the rooftops and birds of steel sailed through the morning sky.\n\nWojciech screamed hoarse orders as his band darted into the old town square, prepared to find the Germans locked and loaded. Instead, they found their brothers and sisters, proudly wearing the Polish flag on their arms. A group of German soldiers sat disarmed and sulking beside the burning husk of a panzer. Looking up, Wojciech realised that the machine guns he had heard weren't German or [RUS.GetAdjective], but of those who, like he, had risen for Poland one last time. A swastika lay strewn beneath the Sukiennice, and for the first time in thirty years, Wojciech's heart swelled with joy as he saw the silver eagle flying above his home, unstained and unbroken.\n\nApproaching the Poles, Wojciech fell to his old, gnarled knees. A younger man turned and saw him, before slowly approaching the elderly Pole. Squatting down, the young man put his arms around Wojciech, feeling the wracking sobs that shook his body."

The German Army did not give up an inch of ground, notably St. Michael's Church held out long after the rest of the city fell, with fanatical Wehrmacht troops refusing to surrender until an air strike destroyed the building and them along with it. This was followed by the raising of the [RUS.GetAdjective] flag, solidifying our victory.\n\nIt's hard to overestimate the great victory we won today, Hamburg provided a great many guns, tanks, and equipment as well as being a major dockyard center to the German Reich. But perhaps more than that the city and its culture was a sign of pride to many Germans, and its flag being burned and our rising in its ashes is some of the best propaganda imaginable. Many see their loss is now inevitable, along with [RUSGetUniqueNamePlain]'s rise to glory beginning.\n\nWhen we went to war with the German scum, none believed we would make it an inch into their territory, let alone the western city of Hamburg. But today their doubts were answered, as our crusade against the scum of the earth led us to victory once again.

As the Heer retreated from Ostland, international observers expected the [RUS.GetAdjective] offensive to surge into Prussia and Poland within weeks. This has not been the case. The vengeful German High Command arrested the commander who allowed the retreat, disciplined the Ostland Colonial Garrison, and ordered a counteroffensive in Riga supplemented with the German Home Guard. As the Kriegsmarine shelled streets carved by seven hundred years of German ingenuity, wave upon wave of Ostland conscripts lacerated themselves upon the barbed tides of the Daugava river. The [RUS.GetAdjective]s defended the city well, until a stray shell crashed into the [RUS.GetAdjective] commander's impromptu headquarters. With their leader slain and communications severely disrupted by the Kreigsmarine attack, the [RUS.GetAdjective] defense grew sloppy and ill-coordinated. A regiment of German soldiers were able to ford the river to the south of the city, then attack the city's largely undefended south-eastern quarter. The city fell within days.\n\nThe Reich is now picking through the tattered remains of the city, attempting to identify the dead and evacuate wounded Germans to hospitals in Prussia. A city-wide anti-partisan operation has already devolved into an anti-Slav pogrom, as hundreds of Latvians and Lithuanians have been lynched, shot, or beaten to death by the enraged Wehrmacht. Many [RUS.GetAdjective] prisoners of war have been executed on charges of terrorism.\n\nThe recapture of Riga signals that the Wehrmacht is not ready to show its belly and die. While Moskowien seems to be firmly in the hands of the [RUS.GetAdjective] government, the reinvigorated Nazi war machine may find a way to reforge the shackles it forced onto the region. Ostland too must suffer the blows of a renewed campaign.

The bitter Finnish government refused to provide any “humanitarian aid” to the [RUS.GetAdjective] garrison, as we continued to constrict what little supply routes the [RUS.GetAdjective] invaders could provide to their soldiers. First by sea, through our Kriegsmarine fleets, then by cutting off their land routes near Lake Lagoda, the invaders began to starve. Soon, the sane [RUS.GetAdjective]s were forced to retreat, and those who didn't desert surrendered quickly to our forces.\n\nThough relatively bloodless, such a siege  not only undermined our time schedules for reclaiming lost territories from the surprising initial [RUS.GetAdjective] assault, but greatly reduced the Ostdeutsch's trust of our garrison. We've established a garrison consisting of reservists to enforce peace through force, much to the exhausted frustration of the local collaborator government.

A large number of native Bela[RUS.GetAdjective]s were dressed in Wehrmacht fatigues, given broken rifles, and forced to charge the [RUS.GetAdjective] defensive positions at nightfall. Once the [RUS.GetAdjective] ammunition reserves were exhausted, German armored divisions emerged from the treeline and opened fire. As the city perimeter burned and buildings crashed to the ground, the [RUS.GetAdjective] commander opted to engage in a fighting retreat through the doomed city rather than face the titanic war machines. Desperate men fought street to street, each bullet buying a rifle or a child a ticket back to Moscow. Their efforts were not enough. By dawn, the flag of sovereign [RUSGetUniqueNamePlain] lay in the mud, and the swastika flew over Smolensk again.\n\nThe recapture of Smolensk is dark news for the supporters of an independent [RUSGetUniqueNamePlain]. The [RUS.GetAdjective] government is unlikely to reclaim the territory of Moskowien without firm control of the border territory. Any possibility of a campaign in Ostland is for the moment silenced, and with the approach to Moscow open again the Wehrmacht is preparing to reclaim the jewel of the East. If Moscow falls again, the [RUS.GetAdjective] spirit will likely never recover.\n\nThe mood in the Reich, on the other hand, is joyous. Military parades have been scheduled throughout Germania as the NSDAP attempts to maintain the image of unshakeable, unquenchable power. Heer commanders and politicians alike scurry from the shadows to plan the reconquest of Moskowien. They see the dawn of a new era shining over the horizon.

While the Volga Germans are stereotyped as more friendly to the [RUS.GetAdjective] government, the heavy handed nature of the [RUS.GetAdjective] occupation, especially the intense surveillance of German neighborhoods and the authorities' seeming unwillingness to stop lynchings and riots by freed [RUS.GetAdjective]s slaves, drove many neutral civilians into the arms of the Reich. Those that owned weapons prepared in secret to attack the [RUS.GetAdjective] garrison, while others engaged in sabotage. A few wealthy factory owners contacted the Wehrmacht in secret and planned a joint attack.Finally, as the nearby Panzerkorps returned to blanket the city in ash, the German militias rose up and attacked the [RUS.GetAdjective] army in the rear. While few of the civilians survived, it was sufficient distraction to permit a breakthrough. The [RUS.GetAdjective]s were forced to retreat across the Volga in defeat.\n\nThe recapture of Paulusburg is a warning sign to the [RUS.GetAdjective] government.

Seebataillon infantry stormed through the Dnieper, while mechanized troops took advantage of the open Ukrainian fields to outmaneuver [RUS.GetAdjective] armored elements. With Kiew occupied in one fell swoop, the [RUS.GetAdjective] army fled east to regroup. Grain stores were torn open, and the Heer made haste to relieve their fatigued divisions.\n\nThe question of the local citizenry's wellbeing was ignored. The Heer ensured that they would be fed without any hint of forced rationing. Consequently, reports of local partisan action filled our headquarters as fast as the reconquest of new villages. The Ukrainians refused to give anything to the Reich: their land, their bread, or their fleeting freedom.\n\nWorries of rump partisan movements, pathetic “armies” incomparable to Horis' or Shumsky's bandits, cannot force the Heer to halt.

The Reich will not allow the [RUS.GetAdjective]s to leave empty-handed as they flee; they will be met with the retribution Jewish influenced barbarians deserve.\n\nThe siege of Astrakhan will be marked in history as the most brutal battle in modern history. The [RUS.GetAdjective] military and Caucasian partisans fought ferociously in the shores of the Volga and the Caspian, and fought to the bitter end in the urban ghettos and markets that dotted the old city. The Wehrmacht crashed upon the city like harsh waves: artillery scourged the streets, and the Luftwaffe transformed every target into smoldering ash. Our Seebatalions made sacrifice after sacrifice, trying to take advantage of any weakness in the entrenched [RUS.GetAdjective] line. After weeks, it was over.\n\nGaps formed, like moths tearing into old garments, allowing the Heer to surge into the gauntlet of Astrakhan's inner city.

Kalmyk, Tatar, Azeri, those who resisted in that battle will suffer the greatest consequences. The oil, and their lives, are ours.

Grossneu is an essential element to the Reich's industrial and military endeavors due to its flocks of oil rigs and position in the center of the Kaukasien front.\n\nThe siege of the city was described as slow and gruesome by the river-crossing divisions that served as the vanguard of the Aryan military. Many reports highlighted the guerilla tactics the [RUS.GetAdjective]-Chechen alliance utilized in the mountains and hills of the city, slowing or completely paralyzing German advances into the city. Eventually, immense bombing operations patterned off those that terrorized the [RUS.GetAdjective]s in the past were liberally applied to their mountain defenses. Soon, the river-crossing divisions were able to ferry troops through the Sunzha river, with thousands of the Heer's elite rapidly securing essential strategic strongholds, allowing for the remaining military to storm into the city. The urban fighting was primarily conducted by snipers and hidden anti-tank units. Weeks of anti-partisan operations culminated in a gruesome massacre in the middle of the city, where hundreds of suspected guerillas were herded into the city square and summarily executed.\n\nAlthough the city has been thoroughly crippled by our bombing campaigns Grossneu has not been pacified. Secondary reports show a revitalized Chechen resistance around the rural communities of the city, which are projected to be an extreme thorn for German logistics.

Nestled between the Trialeti and Saguramo mountain ranges, the city provided a geographical challenge for the general staff to confront; but their greatest advantage. The mountains and the Mt'k'vari river provide pockets for the Heer to easily secure and use as launching pads for our assault into the main urban quarters. The air force and Gebirgsjager units had quickly occupied Mtatsminda and Chughureti, despite initial resistance from the treacherous populace which was quickly pacified by force. With all the main districts seized, the Heer broke through the pockets with heavy air support and artillery bombardments, overwhelming the fatigued and wavering [RUS.GetAdjective] troops and their Georgian partisans . At dusk, the [RUS.GetAdjective] garrison commanders had surrendered, leaving their loyalist partisans to their demise by our army.\n\nDespite our immense success in recapturing Tbilisi, Georgian citizens have made their hatred of our harsh siege known: bricks and other debris were thrown upon our brave soldiers, reports of localized resistance against quartering our exhausted troops by the beleaguered populace, and violent protests have been brewing within Mukhoani district, chanting aimlessly about “freedom” and “the Tbilisi Three”; they shall be dealt with swiftly.\n\nThough the city of the first Kaukasien resistance has been reconquered by our Heer and subjected to military law and order, reports from military police detachments fear that a third Kaukasian uprising may destabilize the Reich's ability to maintain its counter offensives against the [RUS.GetAdjective] invaders, especially with their proximity to our oil wells.

The Teutons were shown no quarter; whether by the Hydra or the Eagle; they could not even see their enemies' faces, for they were covered in darkness and their shields.\n\nThe battle bled into the trenches of the Teutons; reminiscent of the battle of yore, the one upon Rus' ice. Steel clashed against steel, blades dashed the men of Rus and the Teutons, and little delusion was made upon its mercilessness. But soon, Rus' prevailed; but their liberation of their people is still a long exodus."

After forcing the [RUS.GetAdjective] army away from Tyumen with copious amounts of poison gas, the Reich found it had won a hollow victory. The complex system of factories and computers beneath the city were totally destroyed, with little left to aid the German invaders.\n\nOnce the tide turned in the war, the same bunkers that had proven so impossible for the Germans to clear now became death traps in the same way as before. Stalinist partisans who'd escaped the city reverse-engineered the bunkers to destroy the jerry-rigged elevator shafts used to move around the tunnels. German troops, now stuck hundreds of meters below the surface, were flushed out with copious use of grenades, explosives, and rumors even suggest their own chemical weapon stores.\n\nIt is unknown just how many troops were lost in the battle. Orders from Germania meant that a retreat of the Reich's army in the area was impossible, even after it was evident that troops above the surface would be routed within days. A crucial evacuation of the underground areas was abandoned in favor of an attempt to stall the [RUS.GetAdjective]s in the bunkers. With the backfiring of this plan and the complete destruction of all underground infrastructure in Tyumen, the [RUS.GetAdjective] army has achieved an impressive tactical victory.\n\nFor the reversal to become a strategic victory,  the [RUS.GetAdjective] troops will need to push much further and clear the Urals. Should they manage to push past the defensive positions in the mountains, they will be in a much more defensible position. As for Tyumen, the city is completely uninhabitable for the moment. After the Unification Wars and the current conflict, there is almost no functioning infrastructure; surface buildings are hollowed sepulchers. Any refugees will have to live somewhere else, for in the abyss, nothing is left."

As the central government continued to fall back east to avoid being consumed by the Reich's wrath, the local government refused to allow their livelihoods and communities to experience German occupation as their families in the west had experienced. Thus, coalitions of partisans formed in the deep underground of the city: Narodnik agitators, Central Siberian idealists, mercenaries and military remnants. All of them formed a united front against the Germans within the city.\n\nThose who were unable to run were covered by the aid of the underground partisan movement, sent east to safer pastures near Lake Baikal. Those who stayed took up arms, taking advantage of the labyrinthic urban terrain to force the Heer into a steel gauntlet. Reports speak of tank columns ripped in twain, German security forces ambushed and slaughtered, and vital logistics depots bombed into submission.\n\nBy the time the central government finally reorganized a small number of troops to liberate the city, the Heer was completely exhausted and paranoid. The [RUS.GetAdjective] army swept into the battered city like rolling tides, overwhelming the Nazis and forcing its commanders to retreat.\n\nThough the liberation of the city has proven to be a vital strategic victory and morale-booster for the wavering [RUS.GetAdjective] government, many have their doubts if the West will ever be theirs to liberate from decades of occupation, for little remains to feed the starving war machine of the East."

The Heer commander who took charge of the city immediately began a program of terrorism, marching into the homes of civilians and taking their wives and children hostage. In return for their family's safety, the city's men were forced to labor in the Tankograd facilities in grueling sixteen hour shifts, manufacturing parts to support the various Panzerkorps. When the [RUS.GetAdjective] onslaught began, the Nazis ordered the hostages liquidated. Photos of mass graves filled with infants and children are now circulating through [RUSGetUniqueNamePlain]. A few intrepid journalists have contacted their counterparts in Australia, where it is hoped the Nazi's crimes will come to light.\n\nThe lady of the Urals now lies in ruins. The tank factories in Chelyabinsk have been completely destroyed, and most of the city has been annihilated after the Nazi occupiers began an uncontrollable fire in the East district in order to burn down an area occupied primarily by Jews. The blaze ultimately consumed a majority of the city's living space, leaving most of the surviving inhabitants homeless.\n\nThe [RUS.GetAdjective] army now faces a great challenge, but if they can continue their string of victories, then perhaps the liberation of [RUSGetUniqueNamePlain] is possible.

Though the troops may be wounded and perhaps removed from the remainder of the war, their enthusiasm roared in unison with hundreds of thousands of families, platoons and crews in search of a free [RUSGetUniqueNamePlain].\n\nTomsk's citizens refused to break under the harsh German reprisals conducted against their community. Regardless of the books burned, the universities and studios shelled, and the intellectuals deported, the people stood steadfast against their invaders. Reminiscent of Alexander Nevsky and the Novgordians, the Bastillards took the initiative under the leadership of Nikolay Batyuk to fight the Germans upon the Tom river. As they bled for their homeland, they were able to soften the Germans unfortunate enough to be garrisoned on the eastern side of the city as the [RUS.GetAdjective] counter offensive crushed their middling defenses.\n\nIt would take weeks of slow, brutal urban warfare and saboteur counter operations until the western quarters of the old city were liberated.  As the [RUS.GetAdjective]s recuperated from their hard-fought victory, the remnants of the salons who once vibrantly dwelled in the city took no delay to heal the wounded city. Modernist engineers went out to repair vital infrastructure, the Humanists and Decemberists took the initiative to establish a provisional government, creating an united council to govern on behalf of the [RUS.GetAdjective] administration, and the Bastillards dealt swift justice to the Germans who inflicted pain upon the wisdom and soul of the old city.\n\nIt may be true that Tomsk will never return to its original status as the true Athens of Siberia.

While the defense of the city was undercut by defections and mutiny by Tatar nationalists, few within Kazan welcomed the Third Reich with open arms. Since the occupation began German soldiers have committed numerous crimes against Kazani civilians, including drunken brawling, armed robbery, and kidnapping. This alone was not enough to drive the Tatars fully into the [RUS.GetAdjective] camp. However, as the Kazan government began to arrest hooligan German soldiers, the Reich government proclaimed that Aryan personnel were subject to the laws of the German Empire alone, and demanded that all imprisoned servicemen be set free to face trial at the war's conclusion. Continued incidents of criminal misbehavior heightened anti-Nazi sentiments in the city, empowering Ibragim Mingazeyev's United Front. The United Front made contact with the [RUS.GetAdjective] government, and as the [RUS.GetAdjective] Armed Forces bore down upon the city, the United Front poisoned a large number of German personnel with arsenic-laced beer. Together, they wrested the city from German occupation.\n\nMingazeyev's government has placed itself firmly on the side of the [RUS.GetAdjective]s in the ongoing war. [RUS.GetAdjective] diplomats are already hard at work hammering out a deal with the Tatars, offering even greater regional autonomy, mountainous tax breaks, and possibly even immunity from conscription in return for their loyalty. In return, Nationalist officers, bureaucrats, and political leaders have been deported to Central Siberia to face an unknown fate. Most Tatar servicemen have been recruited back into the [RUS.GetAdjective] Armed Forces, although many units have been broken up and circulated to other areas of the front.\n\nA [RUS.GetAdjective] return to Kazan was a necessary, albeit bloody, step on the path to a [RUS.GetAdjective] victory in the war.

As extensive [RUS.GetAdjective] artillery fire softened the city's defenses, the united front began a series of uprisings and slave-strikes, halting production of crucial dig-in defenses. While German soldiers moved to punish the strikers, the disorganization occurred right as a mass assault began to push into the urbanus' perimeter. By the time the fascists secured their lines, many important districts had been lost, and the [RUS.GetAdjective] army moved to secure the city.\n\nThe Heer, now fighting on two fronts, nearly encircled, their position in tatters, were unable to effectively defend their conquest.

When his brigade had orders to move toward the city and retake it from the Germans the war became all the more real. That he or any of his Comrades would lose blood over this.

While [RUS.GetAdjective] units defended the city fiercely, the shaky supply lines and relentless attacks made the ruin impossible to hold. The [RUS.GetAdjective] forces ultimately abandoned the city after losing the Westerplatte Peninsula and the central promenade streets of old.\n\nAs a show of spite to the Germans, the [RUS.GetAdjective] soldiers planted bombs in the outlying peninsula, destroying the Westerplatte Monument dedicated to the heroes of the initial invasion of Poland in 1939 and to Germans who fought against the occupation in the short-lived 'Free City of Danzig'.\n\nAs for the remaining Poles and Kashubians, only doom awaits if Germany holds the city for any significant period of time.

Critically, as part of Breslau's designation as a Festung Stadt, or Fortress City, pillboxes were set up explicitly to face the east. While these were critical to the initial defense of Breslau, they were useless for the [RUS.GetAdjective] army, which would either have to spend valuable time creating holes in the stones or ignore them. However, these pillboxes were very helpful as fortified positions to retake the city, and reports are consistent that machine gun positions in the boxes were extremely effective at securing entire streets once they were captured.\n\nWhile the Heer is triumphant in Silesia, much land remains if they have any hope of reclaiming their full territories.

We are disappointed, to say the least. But perhaps we expected too much from them.\n\nAs the war grinds on, it seems that the fate of the Volga region will be ours, and ours alone, to determine. That is if we can keep it. But if cooler heads had prevailed, we would have won more than a scrap of land. We need international partnerships and the sort of soft power that only the approval of the Americans or the Japanese can bring. This treaty would have been the first step on the road to international trust and goodwill. Yes, the cloud has a silver lining- but it’s still going to rain."

After hours of reading and decoding jargon, it seemed as if the diplomats understood just how loyal to profit they were.\n\nThe German corporations had a simple premise to their letter. The reform of the corporate economy in Germany and its increasing costs to fuel and fund the war effort in their government's great war was infringing too much on its money. Social responsibility, duty to the Fatherland, and the harsh sanctions forced upon their products were exasperating the likes of IG Farben and Daiman-Benz; and their directors have seen the winds of geopolitics change against the Einheitspakt's fate. Thus, they have come with a simple deal to [RUSGetUniqueNamePlain], one that would benefit the [RUS.GetAdjective]s in the war of bravery and resolve, and harm Germany's motivation to keep fighting.\n\nThe corporations will manipulate, bribe and shake up German officials and leaders in order to reduce their confidence towards their Reich's war efforts, in exchange for our cooperation to help reduce targeted sanctions against their products. However, should the war end in our favour, they also demand for special privileges in our economy: tariff and tax cuts, loopholes to prevent additional income and business taxes designed for them, and favoured deals towards their corporations.\n\nBut, do we really want to allow those who enslaved our people like cattle for their profit and fortune?

They had the backbone to not bend over to the corporations' demands, and sent a strong counteroffer back; one that would certainly change the way that they continued to operate. The [RUS.GetAdjective]s were quick and strong to criticize us for our lack of "human morality" and "social responsibility", words that any shareholder would've immediately ripped apart in mockery. But their demands were extremely simple but harsh.\n\nTreat the [RUS.GetAdjective]s in our factories compassionately by implementing proper labour regulations and workers' privileges, equal to the ones implemented for the average German employee in our offices and facilities, or they would end all negotiations and allow their forces to target our property.\n\nThe safehouse was clearly divided, after they all understood these demands. By allowing the [RUS.GetAdjective]s to force their hand onto the German corporations, many conservatives among the meeting were strongly opposed: the [RUS.GetAdjective]s were beaten back in 1954, and they would be beaten again, these demands were unprofitable and shameless to even consider by their opponents! However, there was a wafting sense of fear, the fear that the [RUS.GetAdjective] workers would be incited into creating chaos and crisis. Riots, strikes and bombings filled their minds, and many of the men knew that if they declined, the factories may drop into rubble like their stocks in Frankfurt. By giving into those demands, they could temporarily alleviate these sentiments and also protect their infrastructure from complete assaults from [RUS.GetAdjective] bombings.\n\nThe corporates were divided, their pride and greed fighting against their patriotism and loyalty towards the nation which had given them so much.

They took little effort to be diplomatic in their wording as if it was a declaration of war, just as their cooperation fuelled the Reich's war machine which tore apart the old Union 30 years ago.

Due to their nature as the dominant economic and military-industrial forces in Germany, these actions will certainly benefit us should we continue to win more battles and liberate more people from their holdings. However, bribes and heart-to-hearts won't certainly go well amongst members of our government, especially if it means that the corporations will be more harder to dislodge to show them proper justice for the economic slavery that they forced upon Eastern Europe.\n\nTherefore, we must continue to fight this war with all of our strength and heart, in order to guarantee that these shady dealings are used the best they can to destroy the German government's resolve."

These measures, implemented in order to protect our economy through repeated autarky and diverting all production to the front lines, have allegedly, by the corporation reports, threatened recession and potential bankruptcy for German factories and businesses comparable to the economic crisis our Reich faced in the fifties. As a result, the corporations have stated that they simply cannot fuel a prolonged war effort and still be able to compete with the economic appendages of the other superpowers in the globalizing economy, regardless if the Reich defeats the [RUS.GetAdjective] invasion militarily.\n\nThe corporations have concluded one thing, prolonged war with the [RUS.GetAdjective]s is not only economically unsustainable for the long-term development of the Reich, but may escalate further into desperate measures in an effort to win a decisive war such as the liberal application of nuclear weaponry. Although some in our government highly disagree with these notions, accusing the corporations and elements of our government of being cowardly and treacherous, [RUSGetUniqueNamePlain]'s tenacity and resolve cannot be ignored so lightly, especially with the destructive progress the war has made.

Soon enough, we'll have actionable intelligence on the Heer, including battle plans, equipment specifications, and even a measure of their loyalty to the new regime. The situation in Germany has turned upside down, and if there's a chance we can keep another Heydrich from taking a stab at leadership, well then it's one we have to take. Besides, who knows, maybe one day we'll have a chance to topple the Reich power structure and smash the Nazis flat on their asses.\n\nBy the way, this conversation doesn't leave the room.

We were not informed that the Red Cross Chairman, one Jerome Holland, is a Negro. We are also concerned about the presence of Asiatics, Negroes, Jews, etc in the proposed volunteer group.

Moskowien is filled with cheers and playful laughter, not gunfire. The day will be filled with drinking, singing, and soccer matches. The night will be safe.

The crashing foam of Baltic filled his heart, drowning his worries and bearing his hopes to calm shores. The perfume of sea salt and the stench of his black coffee filled his nose; in the distance, gulls screeched as they flew over the coast of Estonia. Ostland! It was Ostland now, a thriving limb of the Großgermanisches Reich. Just like his own country.\n\nJostein's smile dimmed. He tried hard not to think about Norway's destiny. Really, it wasn't his place. He was just a merchant captain. Hell, he didn't even own his own boat. Jostien was just a cog in a machine, one of countless Scandinavians that made their living shipping IG Farben's medical products from one end of Europe to another. But when his mind drifted to his mother country, he couldn't help but despair. Germany had sunken her talons deep into Norway's flesh- not just politically, but economically too. If his people weren't completely dependent on the Germans, they would be soon.\n\nAnd what would come after that? Would Hadrade's kin ever be free again? Would they be annexed into the Third Reich, like Czechia? Or would they become a mindless appendage, like the Netherlands? There had to be something better. There had to be a better future for his children, and his people.\n\n"Excuse me, Captain?"\n\nJostien recoiled from his reverie. "Seaman Pederson.

He hadn't been able to go back to sleep after Till's call; instead, he'd sat awake, wincing from the pain in his leg and preparing the testimony he was now reciting. At the end of his bed, a lanky, blonde young MI5 agent took down his words in a chest-pocket notebook.\n\nThomas Whitney, the English agent, kept his face stone still. "And what evidence do you have to support this accusation, Mister Fuchs?"\n\nKurt pulled himself up a bit, wincing. "Sorry. You see, I was sent here to meet with your superiors, try to convince them to join the war. But I land here, get half my ass blown off, and now they want me to go back? They need England to join this war, Tom-"\n\n"Mr. Whitney, please."\n\n"- Mister Whitney. They need England to join the war before the Judeo-Bolsheviks smoke our collective asses." Kurt shook his head. "I've fallen out of favor in Germany, Mr. Whitney. The Abwehr have been sniffing around my home, looking for ways to incriminate me."\n\nThe young man adjusted his spectacles. "And did they find anything?"\n\nKurt's mind flashed to the photos, to the restaurant meat locker where the Abwehr agent had blackmailed him. "No, nothing," he said. "But I don't think I was sent here to negotiate. I think I was sent here to die."\n\nSomething shifted behind Whitney's stone mask. He frowned imperceptibly; a grimace appeared and disappeared on his face like a puff of smoke. "Go on."\n\n"The bombing was a false flag attack, I'm sure of it," Kurt said. "They meant to sacrifice me, and your citizens, to outrage the British public. Why, just think of it- a bunch of women and children blown out of the sky by the Slavic menace. They'd have your people baying for blood like Spaniards at a bullfight! And then, they get your army, and my society survives for a few more months." Kurt lay back in his bed, exhausted. "Please, listen to me. We're all in terrible danger."\n\nWhitney nodded, his lip trembling ever so slightly. "You understand that, if this did happen, we would need proof?""
 crisisSWRW.15.a: ""The proof is in the pudding. And right now, the pudding is in Germania.""

 crisisSWRW.16.t: "Turning Point"
 crisisSWRW.16.desc: "It was midnight in Germania. Kurt fumbled into Ministerialdirigent Schulze's office, his baggy, parchment-colored overcoat dripping water onto the floor. "Now," he muttered, "if I was incriminating evidence, where would I be?" He popped his flashlight into his mouth, and began to search. The cool metal tasted of pennies, and hand sweat.\n\nSchulze's office was drowning in gun-metal grey filing cabinets. Every wall was covered in them, and every one was half full of documents. Thus, it was a miracle when, after hours of searching, Kurt came upon the documents he needed. He almost thumbed past them, in fact, when he doubled back, pulled them from their resting place, and threw them on the table.\n\n"Fucking hell..." It was a communique between the Foreign Ministry and the Ministry of Armaments, discussing the distribution of munitions to their allies on the Eastern Front. Hardly unusual in a period of Totaler Kreig. But, nestled at the bottom, hidden in a place where he'd barely seen it, was the following:\n\n"It is also required of the Ministry that a plastic explosive-made of sufficient tonnage to rupture the fuselage of an airplane-be delivered to Abwehr offices in Germania by Friday. Only trusted personnel should be allowed to assist in the delivery of this package."\n\nKurt began to laugh quietly. "Holy shit, this is it!" He held the paper up and gave it a theatrical kiss. "Holy shit, we're saved!"\n\n"Saved from what, Kurt?" Fuchs spun on his heels, his heart suddenly pounding. His assistant Till stood at the door, menacing his petrified “friend” with a revolver in hand and his finger on the trigger. The safety cocked back in preparation. "The Abwehr intercepted your call in England, Kurt. You know we still have friends over there." Till snarled. "How could you betray us? Betray your nation? After everything we've been through!"\n\nKurt raised his hand and backed away. "Till, please. Why don't you just put the gun down so we can talk about this-"\n\n"I'm done with talking!" Till raised the pistol. "You always spoke about the good old days, when Hitler was in power. Well, Hitler wouldn't have let a snake like you corrupt our nation. He'd take action.""
 crisisSWRW.16.a: "Take the shot."
 crisisSWRW.16.b: "Hesitate."

 crisisSWRW.17.t: "No Hesitation"
 crisisSWRW.17.desc: "Till's finger wavered on the trigger. He shook, and beads of sweat began to form on his brow. Kurt saw his chance.\n\n"Till, please. You know me," he said. His voice was light and calm, even as waves of panic reverberated in his chest. "They haven't told you the whole story."\n\n"I heard enough!" Till's voice rang with panic, and rage. "More than enough. You sold us out to the English!"\n\n"Till, they tried to kill me! They meant for me to die on that plane!"\n\n"That's not what Schulze told me," Till said. "He told me they engineered the bomb so you'd survive. But even if you didn't survive- so what? We should all be proud to give our lives for our nation. Klara would've been cared for, Kurt. I would've taken care of her-"\n\nKurt ducked under the muzzle of Till's pistol, grabbed his wrist, and threw him to the ground. The gun fell from his grip like sand in a clenched fist. Before his friend could even realize what'd happened, Kurt grabbed the gun and fired two rounds through Till's head.\n\nIt was an automatic action, really. Not something he'd planned. A primitive impulse leftover from his days in Ostland. But even as Kurt fell to his knees and vomited onto the puddle of gore than had once been his assistant, his coworker, and his friend, the diplomat couldn't help but feel relief. After everything he'd done these years, the number of people he'd sent to their deaths for Germany, what was one more? The notion seemed logical, at least.\n\nKurt tried his best to ignore the stench of human feces. Once he'd emptied his stomach, and dry heaved for good measure, the diplomat crawled over to Schulz's desk. He heaved himself to his feet, grabbed the evidence, and fed it into a nearby fax machine.\n\nMiles away, on the rocky, storm swept beaches of England, a fax machine owned by MI5 received his message."
 crisisSWRW.17.a: "He was already running for the exit."

 crisisSWRW.18.t: "Take the Shot"
 crisisSWRW.18.desc: "Till didn't hesitate. He shot Kurt in the stomach, blasting away his ribs and thrusting shards of metal into his intestines. Pain blossomed in the diplomat's belly like mold growing on an animal carcass. Kurt lunged forward, a murderous rage in his eyes.  “What did you do?” he shouted. His leather shoes caught on the edge of the carpet, and with a final yell of anger the diplomat lost his balance, and struck his head on the edge of Schulze's mahogany desk.\n\nThe impact was terrible, and final. Waves of pain shot through Kurt's skull- the fall alone would have been enough to send him to the hospital. He reached for the wound in his stomach, only to brush at something warm, and wet. The diplomat withdrew his hand, and found it dripping blood. “Till, you fucking bastard!” he shouted. “Look at what you've done.” A stroke of pain sliced his frontal lobe into ribbons, and his anger collapsed into despair. He began to weep.\n\nTill rushed to his friend's side, the smoking revolver still in his hand. Rage, fear, sadness, and hate flashed on his face. “You would've done the same, he sputtered. “If it had been me.”\n\nKurt was in too much pain to speak. His jaw clenched shut, and his teeth ground against each other like the Symplegades' maw. Hot tears fell from his nose and into his mouth.\n\n“The Abwehr agreed to leave Klara alone,” Till said. He coughed. “For what it's worth.”\n\nKurt's blood dripped off his suit, and mingled with the carpet fibers below. The room began to grow hazy, and dark. Terribly dark. Darker than any dark he'd seen before.\n\nTill laid the gun down. “I had to do it!” he yelled. “For the nation. For all Aryans, everywhere. I don't know how it happened but the Jews seduced you. They seduced you!” He grabbed Kurt by the collar, and began to shake his lolling skull. “How did they do it, Kurt? How the fuck did they do it?”\n\nIn the distance, Kurt Fuchs heard some bizarre screaming. The words were unintelligible. And, frankly, it was not his concern anymore. It was his time. He was going home now."

 crisisSWRW.19.t: "From Germania, With Love"
 crisisSWRW.19.desc: "It was already one in the morning, and Thomas Whitney had yet to receive the information he so desperately needed. Negotiations at the conference were ongoing, and the British delegation was still operating in the dark. Either the [RUS.GetAdjective]s or the Germans were vipers whispering lies. If he could just get his hands on some documents...\n\nHe heard a door open behind him. He glanced back and spotted one of the secretaries, Barbara, carrying a folder. He jolted out of his seat, much to her surprise. "Mister Whitney, you said you were waiting for some files?" She held the folder out. Thomas snatched it from her hands, threw it onto the desk, and began rummaging through its contents. "Remember to turn the lights off when you're finished," she added before leaving him to his work.\n\n"Thank you, Barbara," he muttered. The sound of her heels grew fainter behind him. He started organizing the documents into piles. This one was directly from the German Foreign Ministry. And this one was from Abwehr agents. Finally, there was...\n\nHe stopped himself from sorting the file when he spotted the names at the top and bottom of the form. On its surface, it was nothing special. It was a communique between the German Foreign Ministry and the Ministry of Armaments. Most of the arms discussed would be heading to the eastern front in the fight against the [RUS.GetAdjective]s. But nestled at the bottom of the document was the bombshell:\n\n"It is also required of the Ministry that a plastic explosive-made of sufficient tonnage to rupture the fuselage of an airplane-be delivered to Abwehr offices in Germania by Friday. Only trusted personnel should be allowed to assist in the delivery of this package."\n\nThomas couldn't believe it. After chasing so many leads and traveling across the world, he had finally gotten to the truth. He felt his eyes become wet with tears. His mind went once more to the explosion site and the grisly remains of men, women, and children littering the tarmac. At last, they would know justice."
 crisisSWRW.19.a: "The Germans will pay for their betrayal."

 crisisSWRW.20.t: "The Slav Always Lies"
 crisisSWRW.20.desc: "It was now two in the morning. Thomas Whitney had still  received no word from Subminister Fuchs. He tapped his pen lightly against his desk as he let his mind wander. It fled, naturally, to the scene he'd seen flash before his eyes many times since: the image of bodies strewn across the tarmac. He was lucky enough to not have to pass on the news to their loved ones how they had died. Yet, it is his duty to figure out why innocent English citizens had been killed in such a senseless manner. They, and the British nation, demanded answers.\n\nWhy was Fuchs holding out on him? He had seemed to be just as desperate to get at the truth as Thomas was. But then he thought back to their conversation as Fuchs lay in his hospital bed. Without Fuchs' testimony, MI5 would never have gone after evidence to prove the Germans had orchestrated the bombing. And Fuchs was the only survivor of this catastrophe. If the Germans had planned this attack, wouldn't they have wanted him to die in the attack? A British citizen surviving wouldn't have harmed their supposed plans, and yet of all the people to survive, it just so happened to be Fuchs.\n\nThomas began to sketch out an alternative explanation for Fuchs' claims. Perhaps Fuchs had unpaid debts, or some incriminating details which the [RUS.GetAdjective]s had used to blackmail him. Perhaps they had designed and placed the bomb precisely where it needed to be so that Fuchs would survive. And perhaps this whole investigation-made in spite of the claims by Germania that the [RUS.GetAdjective]s had bombed the airport-was a fruitless venture meant to keep the British off their scent and stall them until the [RUS.GetAdjective]s could win the war.\n\nHe began to write his report. The clicking of his typewriter echoed through the empty rooms of the Secret Service building. He should never have trusted Fuchs. He had let himself be tricked by that traitor's machinations, and now the [RUS.GetAdjective]s had kept the truth from the English people for far too long. No more. The world would know the truth..."

Many thought such a traumatic event would inspire the desire for revenge within the English people. However, it seems the spirit of British neutrality has not been broken after all.

There was nothing there.\n\n"Wait a damn minute, where"s my heli-" The butt of a rifle swung into the back of Hofner"s skull, knocking him to the ground.

There was little reason to leave. The Romanian Foreign Ministry, the bureaucracy he"d spent most of his life submerged within, was finally purified. Its halls were stuffed with Legionaries, as they should have been twenty years ago. The Jews and the weak men that permitted their infiltration were dead. The administration churned along, cutting away the vines of uncertainty and  marking the path for the Romano-Dacian race. Sturzda didn"t believe he'd live to see Romania"s complete triumph; he was nearing his ninetieth birthday, and he"d soon be home with his shepherd. Or was he nearing his ninety-first? It was hard to remember.\n\nMihai Botezatu, the Prince"s assistant, pushed his wheelchair down an uneven path. A beautiful patch of daffodils were blooming just out of the Prince"s sight. He couldn"t recall if they were the soft yellow Antonia had loved, or the pure, blanched white he"d come to admire in his later years.\n\n"Beautiful day out, isn"t it?"

Of course, back then the country was still infested..."\n\nSturzda"s voice trailed off as he remembered the dark times. When it seemed that foolish King had separated Romania from her destiny forever, when their natural allies in Germany seemed to turn their backs on his motherland. The dark days when only Sturzda"s silver tongue and his faith had kept the movement alive.\n\n"Well, we don"t need to worry about that anymore, sir," Mihai said. "You saved us all."\n\nSturzda smiled. Yes, he supposed he had.\n\n"By the way," Mihai said, "a missive just arrived from the head office. There"s a situation in Baku.
